Rockwell International Corp. 's Tulsa unit said it signed a tentative agreement extending its contract with Boeing Co. to provide structural parts for Boeing 's 747 jetliners . 
Rockwell said the agreement calls for it to supply 200 additional so-called shipsets for the planes . 
These include , among other parts , each jetliner 's two major bulkheads , a pressure floor , torque box , fixed leading edges for the wings and an aft keel beam . 
Under the existing contract , Rockwell said , it has already delivered 793 of the shipsets to Boeing . 
Rockwell , based in El Segundo , Calif. , is an aerospace , electronics , automotive and graphics concern . 
Frank Carlucci III was named to this telecommunications company 's board , filling the vacancy created by the death of William Sobey last May . 
Mr. Carlucci , 59 years old , served as defense secretary in the Reagan administration . 
In January , he accepted the position of vice chairman of Carlyle Group , a merchant banking concern . 
SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON Inc . 
Thomas E. Meador , 42 years old , was named president and chief operating officer of Balcor Co. , a Skokie , Ill. , subsidiary of this New York investment banking firm . 
Balcor , which has interests in real estate , said the position is newly created . 
Mr. Meador had been executive vice president of Balcor . 
In addition to his previous real-estate investment and asset-management duties , Mr. Meador takes responsibility for development and property management . 
Those duties had been held by Van Pell , 44 , who resigned as an executive vice president . 
Shearson is about 60%-held by American Express Co . 
Great American Bank , citing depressed Arizona real estate prices , posted a third-quarter loss of $ 59.4 million , or $ 2.48 a share . 
A year earlier , the savings bank had earnings of $ 8.1 million , or 33 cents a share . 
For the nine months , it had a loss of $ 58.3 million , or $ 2.44 a share , after earnings of $ 29.5 million , or $ 1.20 a share , in the 1988 period . 
Great American said it increased its loan-loss reserves by $ 93 million after reviewing its loan portfolio , raising its total loan and real estate reserves to $ 217 million . 
Before the loan-loss addition , it said , it had operating profit of $ 10 million for the quarter . 
The move followed a round of similar increases by other lenders against Arizona real estate loans , reflecting a continuing decline in that market . 
In addition to the increased reserve , the savings bank took a special charge of $ 5 million representing general and administrative expenses from staff reductions and other matters , and it posted a $ 7.6 million reduction in expected mortgage servicing fees , reflecting the fact that more borrowers are prepaying their mortgages . 
Arbitragers were n't the only big losers in the collapse of UAL Corp. stock . 
Look at what happened to UAL 's chairman , Stephen M. Wolf , and its chief financial officer , John C. Pope . 
On a day some United Airlines employees wanted Mr. Wolf fired and takeover stock speculators wanted his scalp , Messrs. Wolf and Pope saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of UAL , United 's parent company , dived $ 24.875 on the Big Board to close at $ 198 . 
Including Monday 's plunge , that has given the two executives paper losses of $ 49.5 million , based on what they would have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of UAL gone through at $ 300 a share . 
When bank financing for the buy-out collapsed last week , so did UAL 's stock . 
Even if the banks resurrect a financing package at $ 250 a share , the two executives would still get about $ 25 million less than they stood to gain in the initial transaction . 
Mr. Wolf owns 75,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 250,000 at $ 83.3125 each . 
In the $ 300-a-share buyout , that totaled about $ 76.7 million . 
By yesterday 's close of trading , it was good for a paltry $ 43.5 million . 
Of course , Mr. Wolf , 48 years old , has some savings . 
He left his last two jobs at Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger with combined stock-option gains of about $ 22 million , and UAL gave him a $ 15 million bonus when it hired him . 
His 1988 salary was $ 575,000 , with a $ 575,000 bonus . 
The 40-year old Mr. Pope has n't changed jobs enough -- at least the right ones -- to stash away that kind of money . 
United paid him a $ 375,000 bonus to lure him away from American Airlines , and he was paid a salary of $ 342,122 last year with a $ 280,000 bonus . 
Mr. Pope owns 10,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 150,000 at $ 69 each . 
That came to a combined $ 37.7 million under the $ 300-a-share buy-out , but just $ 21.3 million at yesterday 's close . 
Of the combined $ 114.4 million the two men were scheduled to reap under the buy-out , they agreed to invest in the buy-out just $ 15 million , angering many of the thousands of workers asked to make pay concessions so the buy-out would be a success . 
United 's directors voted themselves , and their spouses , lifetime access to the Friendly Skies -- free first-class travel , and $ 20,000 a year for life as well . 
Conceivably , in a scaled-back buy-out , they could be bumped back to coach seats for life . 
Thomas H. Johnson , president of the Coatedboard division of Mead Corp. , was named president of Manville Forest Products Corp. , a Manville unit , and senior vice president of Manville Corp . 
Mr. Johnson succeeds Harry W. Sherman , who resigned to pursue other interests , in both positions . 
Manville is a building and forest products concern . 
US Facilities Corp. said Robert J. Percival agreed to step down as vice chairman of the insurance holding company . 
`` There was a difference of opinion as to the future direction of the company , '' a spokeswoman said . 
Mr. Percival declined to comment . 
In a statement , US Facilities said Mr. Percival 's employment contract calls for him to act as a consultant to the company for two years . 
He will also remain a director , US Facilities said , but wo n't serve on any board committees . 
Mr. Percival will be succeeded on an interim basis by George Kadonada , US Facilities chairman and president . 
In the same statement , US Facilities also said it had bought back 112,000 of its common shares in a private transaction . 
Terms were n't disclosed . 
The buy-back represents about 3 % of the company 's shares , based on the 3.7 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30 . 
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , US Facilities closed at $ 3.625 , unchanged . 
Three leading drug companies reported robust third-quarter earnings , bolstered by strong sales of newer , big-selling prescriptions drugs that provide hefty profit margins . 
Merck & Co. reported a 25 % increase in earnings ; Warner-Lambert Co. 's profit rose 22 % and Eli Lilly & Co. 's net income rose 24 % . 
The results were in line with analysts ' expectations . 
Merck & Co . 
Merck , Rahway , N.J. , continued to lead the industry with a strong sales performance in the human and animal health-products segment . 
A stronger U.S. dollar reduced third-quarter and first-nine-month sales growth 2 % and 3 % , respectively . 
International sales accounted for 47 % of total company sales for the nine months , compared with 50 % a year earlier . 
Sales for the quarter rose to $ 1.63 billion from $ 1.47 billion . 
Mevacor , Merck 's new cholesterol-lowering drug , had higher sales than any other prescription medicine has ever achieved in the U.S. in the year following introduction , the company said . 
The drug was introduced in West Germany this year . 
Intense competition , however , led to unit sales declines for a group of Merck 's established human and animal-health products , including Aldomet and Indocin . 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Merck shares closed at $ 75.25 , up 50 cents . 
Warner-Lambert Co . 
Warner-Lambert , Morris Plains , N.J. , reported sales that were a record for any quarter and the eighth quarter in a row of 20 % or more per-share earnings growth . 
Spurred by growth in world-wide sales of the company 's prescription drugs , Warner-Lambert said 1989 will be the best year in its history , with per-share earnings expected to increase more than 20 % to about $ 6.10 . 
Sales for the quarter rose to $ 1.11 billion from $ 1.03 billion . 
Prescription-drug world-wide sales rose 9 % in the quarter to $ 340 million ; U.S. sales rose 15 % . 
The segment 's growth was led by sales of the cardiovascular drugs Lopid , a lipid regulator , and Dilzem , a calcium channel blocker . 
World-wide sales of Warner-Lambert 's non-prescription health-care products , such as Halls cough tablets , Rolaids antacid , and Lubriderm skin lotion , increased 3 % to $ 362 million in the third quarter ; U.S. sales rose 5 % . 
Confectionery products sales also had strong growth in the quarter . 
World-wide sales of Trident gum , Certs breath mints , and Clorets gum and breath mints , increased 12 % to $ 277 million . 
Warner-Lambert shares closed at $ 109.50 a share , up $ 1.50 , in Big Board composite trading yesterday . 
Eli Lilly & Co . 
Lilly attributed record third-quarter and nine-month results to world-wide gains for pharmaceuticals , medical instruments and plant-science products despite poor exchange rates for the dollar that slowed sales abroad . 
Earnings continued to pace sales because of a lower tax rate , profit from the renegotiation of the debt instrument received from Faberge Inc. in connection with Lilly 's sale of Elizabeth Arden Inc. in 1987 , and net proceeds from the settlement of patent litigation at Lilly 's Hybritech Inc. unit . 
Third-quarter sales of the Indianapolis , Ind. , company rose 11 % to $ 1.045 billion from $ 940.6 million . 
Nine-month sales grew 12 % to $ 3.39 billion from $ 3.03 billion a year earlier . 
Sales of Prozac , an anti-depressant , led drug-sales increases . 
Higher sales of pesticides and other plant-science products more than offset a slight decline in the sales of animal-health products to fuel the increase in world-wide agricultural product sales , Lilly said . 
Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Inc. and Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. units led growth in the medical-instrument systems division . 
Lilly shares closed yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board at $ 62.25 , down 12.5 cents . 
Reuben Mark , chairman of Colgate-Palmolive Co. , said he is `` comfortable '' with analysts ' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to between 95 cents and $ 1.05 a share . 
That compares with per-share earnings from continuing operations of 69 cents the year earlier ; including discontinued operations , per-share was 88 cents a year ago . 
The per-share estimates mean the consumer-products company 's net income , increased to between $ 69.5 million and $ 76 million , from $ 47.1 million the year-before period . 
Analysts estimate Colgate 's world-wide third-quarter sales rose about 8 % to $ 1.29 billion . 
Mr. Mark attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in Latin America , Asia and Europe . 
Results were also bolstered by `` a very meaningful '' increase in operating profit by Colgate 's U.S. business , Mr. Mark said . 
Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal-care businesses jumped 25 % in the quarter , Mr. Mark added . 
He said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations , blending two sales organizations and focusing more carefully the company 's promotional activities . 
The estimated improvement in Colgate 's U.S. operations took some analysts by surprise . 
Colgate 's household products business , which includes such brands as Fab laundry detergent and Ajax cleanser , has been a weak performer . 
Analysts estimate Colgate 's sales of household products in the U.S. were flat for the quarter , and they estimated operating margins at only 1 % to 3 % . 
`` If you could say their business in the U.S. was mediocre , but great everywhere else , that would be fine , '' says Bonita Austin , an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co . 
`` But it 's not mediocre , it 's a real problem . '' 
Mr. Mark conceded that Colgate 's domestic business , apart from its highly profitable Hill 's Pet Products unit , has lagged . 
`` We 've done a lot to improve -LCB- U.S. . -RCB- results , and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. Mark said . 
`` Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company . '' 
To focus on its global consumer-products business , Colgate sold its Kendall health-care business in 1988 . 
H. Anthony Ittleson was elected a director of this company , which primarily has interests in radio and television stations , increasing the number of seats to five . 
Osborn also operates Muzak franchises , entertainment properties and small cable-television systems . 
Mr. Ittleson is executive , special projects , at CIT Group Holdings Inc. , which is controlled by Manufacturers Hanover Corp . 
The Boston Globe says its newly redesigned pages have a `` crisper '' look with revamped fixtures aimed at making the paper `` more consistent '' and `` easier to read . '' 
Maybe so -- if you can find where your favorite writer went . 
Beantown scribes , who spare no invective when taking on local luminaries such as Michael `` Pee Wee '' Dukakis , or New England Patriots Coach Raymond `` Rev. Ray '' Berry , yesterday poured ridicule on new drawings of Globe columnists that replaced old photos in the revamped pages this week . 
By late last night , Globe Managing Editor Thomas Mulvoy , bending to the will of his troops , scrapped the new drawings . 
For a few days at least , he says , no pictures or drawings of any kind will adorn the columns . 
Trouble was , nobody thought they looked right . 
Globe columnist Mike Barnicle -- in the second attack on his employer in as many weeks -- averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad , it looked `` like a face you 'd find on a bottle of miracle elixir that promises to do away with diarrhea in our lifetime . '' 
Mr. Barnicle reminded readers that he still has n't forgiven Globe management for questioning a $ 20 expense chit he submitted for parking his car while chasing a story . 
`` I thought -LCB- the drawing -RCB- a cross between someone you 'd spot whipping open his trench coat ... or a guy who boasted he 'd been Charles Manson 's roommate for the last 19 years , '' he said . 
Mr. Barnicle was hardly kinder to the renderings of colleagues Michael Madden -LRB- `` appears to be a pervert '' -RRB- , Will McDonough -LRB- `` looks as if he drove for Abe Lincoln '' -RRB- or Bella English , whose `` little girl now screams hysterically every time she sees a newspaper . '' 
Lynn Staley , the Globe 's assistant managing editor for design , acknowledges that the visages were `` on the low end of the likeness spectrum . '' 
Rival Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr , who usually rails at Statehouse `` hacks '' and nepotism , argued that the new drawings were designed to hide Mr. Madden 's `` rapidly growing forehead '' and the facial defects of `` chinless '' Dan Shaughnessy , a Globe sports columnist . 
`` But think of the money you , the reader , will save on Halloween , '' said Mr. Barnicle . 
`` Instead of buying masks for your kids , just cut out the columnists ' pictures ... . 
Deeply ingrained in both the book review `` Kissing Nature Good-bye '' by Stephen MacDonald -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Sept. 27 -RRB- and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity . 
Is such a view justified ? 
In the absence of humans , would the Earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term ? 
Clearly not . 
About 20,000 years ago the last ice age ended . 
Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America , northern Europe and Asia . 
This global warming must have been entirely natural -- nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand hunter-gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves . 
Furthermore , no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming . 
It is probably continuing and may well account for most of , or all of , present-day global warming . 
I bow to no one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage , but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the Dominant Culture to lock us into the capitalist-exploiters-greedy-American-consumers-global - warming scenario as the sole model for discussion .

The Internal Revenue Service plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation . 
In addition , the tax-collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new high-level positions to guide the 120,000-employee agency : a comptroller to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system , which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world . 
The IRS also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer , who will be hired from within the agency . 
IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said the changes are intended to bring `` accountability '' to the agency , which has an annual budget of more than $ 5 billion and collects about $ 1 trillion a year . 
`` My assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget , '' Mr. Goldberg said . 
`` And we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend $ 5 billion properly . '' 
Mr. Goldberg , who took over as head of the IRS in July , has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency , waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency . 
The IRS operates on a computer system designed in 1961 , which it has been trying to modernize for years . 
And the agency , which operated throughout fiscal 1989 with a $ 360 million budget shortfall , has been under a hiring freeze since last fall . 
The new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward enhancing its ability to collect more tax revenue . 
`` I think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which , in turn , I believe will result in a significant increase in revenue , '' he said . 
The IRS hopes to fill the new positions soon . 
Customarily , it would appoint career civil servants from within the agency , but Mr. Goldberg said he plans to `` scour the world '' for the chief information officer and the comptroller . 
Although the jobs will probably pay between $ 70,000 and $ 80,000 a year , IRS officials are confident that they can attract top-notch candidates from the private sector . 
`` You 're telling someone they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever , '' Mr. Goldberg said . 
`` On the comptroller side , you 're developing and making work financial controls governing a $ 6 billion budget . 
When Maj. Moises Giroldi , the leader of the abortive coup in Panama , was buried , his body bore several gunshot wounds , a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs . 
They were the signature of his adversary , Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega . 
The rebel officer 's slow and painful death , at the headquarters of Panama 's Battalion-2000 squad , was personally supervised by Gen. Noriega , says a U.S. official with access to intelligence reports . 
Leaping into rages , sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust , Mr. Noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup , according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City . 
He is now changing the place he sleeps every night , sometimes more than once a night . 
His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts -- his full-time mistress , Vicky Amado , and her mother , Norma . 
And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup-makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters . 
More enemies to be dealt with . 
In the two weeks since the rebellion , which the U.S. hesitantly backed , Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal - and efficient - in maintaining power . 
Yet , while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades . 
America 's war on the dictator over the past two years , following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988 , is the legacy of that relationship . 
Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega , it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama 's long history of conspirators and pirates . 
For most of the past 30 years , the marriage was one of convenience . 
In 1960 , for example , when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute , according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period . 
The woman had nearly died . 
But U.S. intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away . 
Mr. Noriega 's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests . 
From that point on , the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian 's misadventures . 
The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators , but none quite so resourceful . 
The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega is n't as smooth as the shah of Iran , as well-born as Nicaragua 's Anastasio Somoza , as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti 's Baby Doc Duvalier . 
Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them . 
And out of necessity : The U.S. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power , but a single error on his part could cost him his life . 
`` The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along , '' says Ambler Moss , a former Ambassador to Panama . 
`` He has mastered the art of survival . '' 
In keeping with America 's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega , recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival . 
Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama 's dire economic situation , says Mr. Moss , but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression , and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement . 
`` If the U.S. had sat back and done nothing , he might not have made it through 1988 , '' Mr. Moss contends . 
Perhaps most important , Mr. Noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne . 
One Colombian drug boss , upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile , sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name . 
`` He is cornered , '' says the Rev. Fernando Guardia , who has led Catholic Church opposition against Noriega . 
`` The Americans have left him without a way out . 
It is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option . '' 
His chief advantage in the fight : his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses . 
Mr. Noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos , who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation . 
The U.S. discovered the young Tony Noriega in late 1959 , when he was in his second year at the Chorrillos Military Academy in Lima , according to former U.S. intelligence officials . 
The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega 's half-brother , a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado . 
Luis Carlos , knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer , relayed Tony 's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and , more important , among his officers and instructors . 
A spy was born . 
It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega , who was known to his friends as Cara la Pina -- pineapple face . 
Born the illegitimate son of his father 's maid , he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City . 
Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets , and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate . 
He considered himself intellectually superior to his Peruvian peers , many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well-off families to the highly disciplined , French-modeled academy as a sort of reform school . 
In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed , French-made uniform , Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life , friends from the period say . 
`` He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism , where officers were the elite with special privileges , '' recalls Darien Ayala , a fellow student in Peru and a lifelong friend . 
Mr. Noriega 's relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967 , intelligence officials say . 
His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison , Major Omar Torrijos , gave him an intriguing assignment : Mr. Noriega would organize the province 's first intelligence service . 
The spy network would serve two clients : the Panamanian government , by monitoring political opponents in the region , and the U.S. , by tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized at United Fruit Co. 's banana plantations in Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles . 
United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama 's national income . 
Satisfying its interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader . 
Mr. Noriega 's initial retainer was only $ 50 to $ 100 a month , plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX , a former intelligence official says . 
It was modest pay by American standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $ 300 to $ 400 monthly . 
`` He did it very well , '' recalls Boris Martinez , a former Panamanian colonel who managed Mr. Noriega and his operation . 
`` He started building the files that helped him gain power . '' 
A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City , capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy . 
By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready cache of information . 
He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk , which had been found with their mistresses . 
This proved particularly valuable to the Panamanian government in 1967 , when union leaders were planning a May Day march that the government feared could turn violent . 
Mr. Noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy . 
So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of Puerto Armuelles , which was ruled by United Fruit Co . 
The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control . 
`` It was like a play on Broadway , '' recalls Mr. Martinez . 
`` Noriega managed the whole thing . 
He was superb . 
Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people . '' 
During his years in Chiriqui , however , Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious . 
Rodrigo Miranda , a local lawyer and human-rights monitor , recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David , where he had his offices . 
Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office . 
`` People started wondering if something was wrong with him , '' Mr. Miranda recalls . 
But through this period , so far as the U.S. military was concerned , Mr. Noriega was a model recruit . 
He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967 , according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret . 
He flew to Fort Bragg , N.C. , in September of that year for a course in psychological operations , returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two-month course called `` military intelligence for officers . '' 
Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty , but they did so falsely . 
He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama 's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier . 
He became Gen. Torrijos 's inseparable shadow , and the holder of all Panama 's secrets . 
Mr. Noriega , by now a lieutenant colonel , expanded his contacts to include the Cubans -- not to mention the Israelis , the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking . 
When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega 's moonlighting , intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans . 
`` Early on in the State Department , we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel , in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States , '' recalls Francis J. McNeil , who , as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs , first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977 . 
`` Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans . '' 
Even at this early stage , drugs caused additional concerns . 
During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers . 
One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega , one of which was assassination . 
The head of the DEA at the time , John Ingersoll , scotched the assassination plan . 
But he did fly to Panama to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials , including Mr. Noriega . 
Mr. Ingersoll later recalled that Gen. Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U.S. . 
`` Everybody was afraid of him , '' Mr. Ingersoll says . 
Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976 , when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army 's 470th Military Intelligence Group . 
The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos 's own phone , according to American intelligence officials . 
`` We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar , '' says former CIA Director Stansfield Turner . 
For the first time , the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense , Mr. Turner says . 
`` In the world of intelligence , if you want to get information , you get it from seedy characters . 
The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you . '' 
Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr. Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others . 
Mr. Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U.S. contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration . 
The U.S. soon found new cause for concern : gun-running . 
Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza . 
They included one of Mr. Noriega 's closest friends and business partners , Carlos Wittgreen . 
And the investigators were quickly closing in on Mr. Noriega himself . 
At the time , though , in 1979 , the U.S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy . 
Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon . 
Dade County and federal authorities , learning that he intended to fly through Miami , made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil . 
It was a Friday in June . 
The Pentagon foiled the plan . 
According to military officers at the time , word was passed to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting . 
On Monday , U.S. officials received a routine , unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama . 
`` Due to health reasons , Lt. Col. Noriega has elected to postpone his visit to Washington , '' it read . 
Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback . 
Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen , the friend of Mr. Noriega , and the other four was dismissed on a technicality . 
But now , along with reindicting Mr. Noriega 's pal , they intended to charge Mr. Noriega himself , on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $ 2 million in arms . 
In January 1980 , Jerome Sanford , as assistant U.S. attorney , was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms in Miami . 
Panamanian dictator Torrijos , he was told , had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington . 
Mr. Sanford was told Mr. Noriega 's friend , Mr. Wittgreen , would be handling the shah 's security . 
It would n't be a good idea to indict him -- much less Mr. Noriega , the prosecutor was told . 
After prodding from Mr. Sanford , U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed . 
`` Unfortunately , '' Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter , `` those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control . '' 
The letter , along with a detailed prosecution memo , sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death . 
`` I think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now , '' Mr. Sanford says . 
`` If he had been found guilty , we could have stopped him . '' 
In August 1983 , Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama , having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos . 
Soon , the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses . 
The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega 's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll . 
Payments averaged nearly $ 200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA . 
Although working for U.S. intelligence , Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively . 
During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas . 
He allegedly entered into Panama 's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses , according to Floyd Carlton , a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges . 
But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House would n't act against him , recalls his close ally Jose Blandon , because he had an insurance policy : his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua . 
Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama . 
Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua . 
And on at least one occasion , in the spring of 1985 , he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua . 
Although , his help for the Contra cause was limited , it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration , says Sen. Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat who then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee . 
`` Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin , '' he says . 
An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington -- by compromising U.S. officials . 
Curtin Windsor , then the ambassador to Costa Rica , recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega 's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and `` quiet , serious conversation '' on the Aswara Peninsula . 
Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs , the U.S. ambassador to Panama , of the invitation . 
`` Briggs screamed , '' Mr. Windsor recalls . 
He says Mr. Briggs told him he was being set up for a `` honey trap , '' in which Mr. Noriega would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event `` with sound and video . '' 
Mr. Briggs , on vacation after resigning his position at the National Security Council , could n't be reached for comment . 
As Mr. Noriega 's political troubles grew , so did his offers of assistance to the Contras , an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington . 
For instance , he helped steal the May 1984 Panamanian elections for the ruling party . 
But just one month later , he also contributed $ 100,000 to a Contra leader , according to documents released for Oliver North 's criminal trial in Washington , D.C . 
Yet , his political setbacks mounted . 
Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora , his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges . 
He then ousted President Nicholas Ardito Barletta , a former World Bank official with close ties to the U.S. , after Mr. Barletta tried to create a commission to investigate the murder . 
And , all the while , Panama 's debt problems continued to grow . 
Mr. Noriega was growing desperate . 
In late 1986 , he made an offer he thought the U.S. could n't refuse . 
As recounted in a stipulation that summarized government documents released for the North trial , Mr. Noriega offered to assassinate the Sandinista leadership in exchange `` for a promise to help clean up Noriega 's image and a commitment to lift the -LCB- U.S. . -RCB- ban on military sales to the Panamanian Defense Forces . '' 
`` North , '' the document went on , referring to Oliver North , `` has told Noriega 's representative that U.S. law forbade such actions . 
The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things , just as Noriega had helped -LCB- the U.S. . -RCB- the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal . '' 
Col. North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams , who relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz . 
Mr. Noriega 's proposal was turned down . 
And Mr. Shultz curtly told Mr. Abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image . 
The end of the marriage was at hand . 
Within weeks the unfolding Iran-Contra scandal took away Mr. Noriega 's insurance policy . 
The death of CIA Director William Casey and resignation of Oliver North allowed anti-Noriega political forces to gain influence . 
Public protests against him were triggered in June 1987 due to charges by Diaz Herrera , his former chief of staff , that Mr. Noriega had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of Messrs. Spadafora and Torrijos . 
Few American officials were willing any longer to defend him . 
Lawyers in Miami -- this time working virtually without impediment -- prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in February 1988 . 
During negotiations with American officials in May 1988 over proposals to drop the U.S. indictments in exchange for his resignation , Mr. Noriega often asked almost plaintively how the Americans , whom he had helped for so many years , could turn against him . 
Now , neither side -- the U.S. nor Mr. Noriega -- has an easy out . 
President Bush has sworn to bring him to justice . 
Mr. Noriega believes he has n't any alternative but to continue clutching to power . 
It is a knock-out battle -- perhaps to the death . 
In the end , is Mr. Noriega the political equivalent of Frankenstein 's monster , created by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power ? 
Not quite , Sen. Leahy contends . 
`` For short-term gains , people were willing to put up with him . 
That allowed him to get stronger and stronger , '' he says . 
`` I do n't think we created him as much as we fed him , nurtured him and let him grow up to be big and strong . 
UPJOHN Co. reported that third-quarter net income rose to $ 96 million , or 52 cents a share , from $ 89.6 million , or 49 cents a share , a year earlier . 
Yesterday 's edition provided analysts ' estimates for the company when actual earnings were available . 
Industrial production declined 0.1 % in September , reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend . 
The Federal Reserve Board said output of the nation 's factories , mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 % in the third quarter , substantially slower than the 3.3 % annual rate in the second quarter . 
`` Capital spending and exports , which have been the driving force in this expansion , are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them , '' said Robert Dederick , economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . 
The new reports of sluggishness , which were foreshadowed by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September , give the Fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates . 
`` They need to do something about this , '' said Maury Harris , economist at PaineWebber Group Inc . 
The Fed also said U.S. industry operated at 83.6 % of capacity last month , down from 83.8 % in August . 
Measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures . 
Factory output dropped 0.2 % , its first decline since February , after having been unchanged in October . 
Factories operated at 83.7 % of capacity , the lowest rate in more than a year and down from 84.1 % in September . 
The declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods , those intended to last more than three years . 
The biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers , a category that includes the steel industry . 
Output of business equipment was unchanged in September . 
Production of factory equipment , one indication of the strength of manufacturers ' investment spending , fell 0.3 % . 
Some economists expect further declines in investment spending . 
`` Whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soften subsequently , '' Mr. Harris said . 
`` You have n't seen the full effect of that yet . '' 
A decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto assemblies , the Fed noted . 
Analysts do n't expect the September surge in auto production to be repeated in the coming months . 
Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board 's report on industrial production in September . 
The figures are seasonally adjusted . 
142.3 % of the 1977 average . 
Robin Honiss , president and chief executive officer of this bank holding company , was elected to the additional posts of chairman , president and chief executive of the company 's New England Savings Bank subsidiary . 
William R. Attridge resigned those posts , as well as a seat on NESB 's board . 
NESB is also the parent of Omnibank . 
Lung-cancer mortality rates for people under 45 years of age have begun to decline , federal researchers report . 
The drop is particularly large for white males , although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality rates . 
A report in this week 's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute also projects that overall U.S. mortality rates from lung cancer , the leading cause of cancer death , should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate . 
The report , which comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking , is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer . 
`` What this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact , '' said Melvyn Tockman , an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore . 
The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart . 
The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 , but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 , a decline of 28.7 % . 
Measured the same way , the decline for black males was 14.2 % . 
The drop in mortality rates for women was less steep -- 8.9 % for blacks and 5.3 % for whites . 
The study , by Susan Devesa , William Blot and Joseph Fraumeni of the institute 's staff , also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the 35-44 age bracket , except black men . 
Although lung-cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole , the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year 2000 for women . 
Lung-cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over 55 , with sharp increases for everybody but white men . 
But Dr. Fraumeni , one of the authors of the report , said `` the declining rates we 're seeing for younger people we believe may be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future . '' 
However , he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking . 
`` Even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups , they ca n't be taken for granted , '' the report says . 
`` Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population , especially children , adolescents and minorities . '' 
An editorial in the NCI Journal says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality `` among young men and women in the U.S. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle -- this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $ 2 billion a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking . '' 
But the editorial , by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization , notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries . 
`` Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior '' around the world , the editorial says , through the enactment of laws that limit advertising , boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education . 
Asked for comment , Walker Merryman , a vice president of the Tobacco Institute , said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the U.S. could violate the First Amendment protection of free speech . 
According to the American Cancer Society , smoking is responsible for 85 % of the lung-cancer cases among men and 75 % among women . 
The NCI report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns . 
A higher proportion of black men smoke than white men . 
While nearly equal percentages of black and white women currently smoke , in both sexes more whites have given up smoking than blacks . 
In comparing changes in mortality rates over the past decade , the NCI study looked only at blacks and whites . 
Asians and native Americans were n't studied ; Hispanics were included with whites . 
Recent changes in average annual age-specific lung-cancer rates per 100,000 population by race and sex .

Traders trying to profit from the recent volatility in financial markets invaded the Nasdaq over-the-counter market , prompting even more swings in stock prices . 
After gaining strength during a brief run-up when trading began , the Nasdaq Composite Index weakened under selling pressure . 
The forces at work included computer-guided trading , as well as profit-driven market makers and institutional investors who had bought stock on the cheap during the recent correction . 
During the last two hours of trading , the composite almost drew even on the day before slipping again . 
The Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.05 , or 0.2 % , to 459.93 . 
The action was confined to Nasdaq 's biggest and most liquid stocks , traders said . 
The Nasdaq 100 Index began the day at 449.89 , lost 2 % at one point , and was up 0.4 % at another . 
The barometer of the biggest nonfinancial stocks settled at 448.49 , off 1.40 . 
Its counterpart , the Nasdaq Financial Index , was weak for most of the day , sliding 2.51 to 453.57 by the end of trading . 
The volatility was dizzying for traders . 
`` The market must have turned up and down 15 different times , '' commented Lance Zipper , head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody . 
`` Every time you thought it was going into a rally it gave up , and every time you thought it would rally it came down . 
This is a tough market . '' 
Mr. Zipper said the market is still settling down after the recent correction . 
Most of trading action now is from professional traders who are trying to take advantage of the price swings to turn a quick profit , he and other traders said . 
`` Everybody 's confused and no one has an opinion that lasts longer than 30 seconds , '' said Mr. Zipper . 
`` A lot of the professional traders are just going back and forth . 
They 're just as confused . '' 
William Rothe , head of OTC trading at Alex . Brown & Sons , in Baltimore , said program trading is keeping the markets unsettled . 
He believes that the volatile conditions created by program trading has `` thoroughly confused '' investors about where the market is headed . 
Program trading is `` benefiting a few to the detriment of many and I wish someone would do something about it , '' he complained . 
Trading activity cooled off from Monday 's sizzling pace . 
Share turnover subsided to 161.5 million . 
Advancing and declining issues finished about even . 
Of the 4,345 stocks that changed hands , 1,174 declined and 1,040 advanced . 
One big technology issue , Novell , rode the roller coaster . 
The stock , which finished Monday at 29 1\/2 , traded as high as 29 3\/4 and as low as 28 3\/4 before closing at 29 1\/4 , down 1\/4 . 
It was a jarring day for investors in Genetics Institute . 
The stock tumbled 2 3\/4 on news that it might have to take a charge against earnings if it ca n't successfully resolve a dispute with its European licensee , Boehringer Mannheim , over its anti-anemia drug , EPO . 
The stock recovered somewhat to finish 1 1\/4 lower at 26 1\/4 . 
In a statement , Genetics Institute said the dispute with Boehringer centers on questions of the usability of certain batches of EPO material valued at $ 13.6 million . 
Earlier this week , Genetics Institute reported wider losses in its fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31 . 
Price Co. jumped 2 1\/4 to 44 on 1.7 million shares . 
The wholesaler of cash and carry merchandise reported fiscal fourthquarter earnings that were better than analysts had expected . 
The company also pleased analysts by announcing four new store openings planned for fiscal 1990 , ending next August . 
That will bring the total for the year to 10 , from five during fiscal 1989 . 
`` Every year we 've been waiting for stepped-up expansion from the company . 
The news could n't have been better , '' said Linda Kristiansen , a Dean Witter Reynolds analyst , in an interview . 
Intermec , a maker of optical character-recognition devices , also reported higher third-quarter earnings . 
Its shares added 3\/4 to 30 3\/4 . 
But favorable earnings was n't a guarantee that a stock 's price would improve yesterday . 
MCI Communications tumbled 2 5\/8 to 42 3\/8 on 4.7 million shares even though the telecommunications giant reported a 63 % increase in third-quarter profit . 
CoreStates Financial slipped 3\/8 to 43 1\/8 in active trading after reporting that third-quarter earnings improved to $ 1.27 a share from $ 1.15 a share a year earlier .

Certainly conservative environmentalists can defend their limited government position by differentiating between Old Environmentalism and New Environmentalism -LRB- `` Journalists and Others for Saving the Planet , '' by David Brooks , editorial page , Oct. 5 -RRB- . 
Old Environmentalism involved microbe hunters and sanitationists . 
It started with improvements in hygiene made possible by affordable soap and washable underwear during the Industrial Revolution . 
Then cast-iron sewer pipe and the flush toilet were followed by sewage - and water-treatment plants toward the end of the 19th century . 
Medicine in the 19th century was dedicated mostly to combating sepsis and diagnostic analysis . 
Then the 20th century saw the evolution of private-sector wonder drugs , which promulgated medical therapy . 
The process dramatically increased our average life expectancy , eliminated much pain and constantly improved health and well-being . 
Most public-health measures were handled at the local level . 
New Environmentalism probably started in 1962 with the publication of Rachel Carson 's book `` Silent Spring . '' 
Shortly thereafter , hysterical articles began to appear predicting that advanced industrial societies would produce a blackened , uninhabitable planet possibly by the turn of the century . 
These apocalyptic predictions were advanced by such stalwarts as Paul Ehrlich , Barry Commoner , Rene Dubois and George Wald . 
Writing in the 1960s Ms. Carson suggested that the human race could be eliminated in 20 years , and Mr. Wald suggested that life on earth might end by 1985 . 
Mr. Ehrlich predicted unprecedented famine by 1980 . 
There were many more . 
Thousands of chemical products were categorized as carcinogenic , with recommendations that they be banned from industrial use because they produced malignant tumors in overdosed rats . 
Unknown before 1960 were the inconclusive effects of acid rain , greenhouse warming and ozone depletion , all of which required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense . 
Meanwhile , the New Environmentalists systematically opposed the methods of the Old Environmentalists . 
Local pollution problems require cheap energy and capital for their solution . 
But the New Environmentalists oppose private wealth creation -LRB- which , they claim , depletes natural resources -RRB- and nuclear power -LRB- even though it would counteract the greenhouse effect -RRB- . 
They are in the forefront of opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering . 
New Environmentalism is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power . 
Let 's rationalize our priorities by solving pollution problems at the local level as heretofore .

Your story missed some essential points of the conference on `` The Global Environment : Are We Overreacting ? '' 
First and foremost , the vignettes presented by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment . 
Consider , for example , the greenhouse effect and climate change ; numerous blue-ribbon scientific committees , including one from the National Academy of Science , judge there is a greater than 50 % probability of a grave problem in the offing . 
The point was to answer the question in the conference title , not to try to create news stories for the event itself . 
Nor was it intended to dictate a set of prescriptive solutions , although various points were raised . 
Each speaker was asked to address a specific topic , not deliver a point of view . 
Each scientist independently concluded society and government are underreacting when it comes to substantive policy change . 
This leads to a very special sense of urgency . 
If the media decide to work harder at educating the public about these complex and technical issues , that hardly can be termed non-objective journalism . 
The environment can no longer be a normal issue , to be dealt with on a business-as-usual basis with comfortable increments of change . 
We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet 's atmosphere . 
This portends consequences from what we have already done that will be very destabilizing to social and economic systems . 
The problems of the environment are so interrelated , so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than 10 years . 
The consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes . 
No , we are not overreacting . 
Thomas E. Lovejoy Assistant Secretary for External Affairs Smithsonian Institution 
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. , fulfilling its dismal earnings forecast for 1989 , said its third-quarter net income fell 68 % on flat revenue . 
Stung by higher marketing costs and slowing volume growth , the giant Coke bottling operation said net fell to $ 12.7 million , or six cents a share , from $ 39.9 million , or 26 cents a share , the year earlier . 
The results met estimates of analysts , who had already slashed their projections after the company said in late August that its 1989 earnings could tumble as much as 37 % . 
A company spokesman said yesterday that Coca-Cola Enterprises sticks by its 1989 forecast . 
Third-quarter revenue was flat at $ 1.02 billion . 
The year-ago results , however , included the operations of a bottling business , which was sold last December . 
Excluding that bottling business , Coca-Cola Enterprises ' volume , measured by cases of soda , rose only 1 % . 
The volume is well below the industry 's 4 % to 5 % growth rate of recent years , but in line with other soft-drink companies for the third quarter . 
The latest third-quarter volume also compares with a very strong 10 % growth in the year-ago quarter . 
Coca-Cola Enterprises blamed the lower volume on its soft-drink prices , which were about 3 % higher in the third quarter . 
Consumers have been accustomed to buying soft-drinks at discounted prices for several years . 
Coca-Cola Enterprises said it had to boost spending for trade and dealer incentives to try to keep volumes from slipping . 
The company said it expects consumers will adjust to higher-priced soft drinks . 
A spokesman attributed the bulk of a 14 % increase in selling , administrative and general expenses -- to $ 324.9 million -- to marketing costs . 
`` They 're out there promoting like crazy , trying to get prices up by promotion , '' said Roy Burry , an analyst with Kidder , Peabody & Co . 
For the nine months , Coca-Cola Enterprises ' net fell 31 % to $ 65 million , or 39 cents a share , from $ 93.8 million , or 63 cents a share . 
Revenue was flat at about $ 2.97 billion . 
Coca-Cola Enterprises , which is 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co. , also said it repurchased about 1.2 million of its common shares during the third quarter . 
The buy-back is part of a 25-million-share repurchase plan , under which Coca-Cola Enterprises so far has acquired a total of 9.7 million shares . 
Separately , Purchase , N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc. , as expected , said fiscal third-quarter net rose 11 % to $ 269.3 million , or $ 1.02 a share , from $ 241.6 million , or 91 cents a share . 
Sales rose 25 % to $ 3.90 billion from $ 3.13 billion . 
The year-ago quarter 's results include an after-tax charge of $ 5.9 million from the sale of a winery in Spain . 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Coca-Cola Enterprises closed at $ 16.375 a share , down 62.5 cents . 
PepsiCo closed at $ 58.50 a share , up $ 1.375 . 
L.J. Hooker Corp. is expected to reach an agreement in principle this week to sell Merksamer Jewelers Inc. to management , say executives familiar with the talks . 
L.J. Hooker , based in Atlanta , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year . 
Currently , its parent company , Hooker Corp. of Sydney , Australia , is being managed by a court-appointed liquidator . 
It is expected that GE Capital Corp. , a financial-services subsidiary of General Electric Co. , will provide much of the funding for the proposed leveraged buy-out of Merksamer , based in Sacramento , Calif . 
A spokesman for GE Capital declined to comment . 
GE Capital has a working relationship with L.J. Hooker . 
It is providing $ 50 million in emergency financing to the company and has agreed to buy as much as $ 75 million in receivables from B. Altman & Co. and Bonwit Teller , L.J. Hooker 's two fully owned department-store chains . 
Sam Merksamer , chief executive officer of the nationwide jewelry chain , and Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L.J. Hooker Corp. , both declined to comment . 
Currently , Mr. Merksamer owns 20 % of the company ; L.J. Hooker acquired its 80 % interest in the firm in May 1986 . 
At the time , the Merksamer chain had 11 stores in operation . 
Today , there are 77 units , all located in shopping malls . 
In recent weeks Mr. Merksamer has approached a number of his suppliers and asked them to provide letters of intent saying they will continue shipping merchandise to the chain following the buy-out , say those familiar with the situation . 
This year , a number of retail leveraged buyouts have failed , causing jitters among suppliers , and Mr. Merksamer apparently wanted assurances that he wo n't have delivery problems . 
For the year ended June 30 , 1989 , Merksamer Jewelers had $ 62 million of revenue and operating profit of $ 2.5 million . 
The jewelery chain was put up for sale in June . 
According to those familiar with the situation , other bidders included Ratners Group PLC of London and Kay Jewelers Inc . 
First Boston Corp. is advising L.J. Hooker on the sale of the Merksamer business . 
Merksamer was the first in a series of retail acquisitions made by L.J. Hooker . 
The company was founded in Sacramento in 1929 by two brothers , Ralph and Walter Merksamer , who operated as DeVon 's Jewelers . 
In 1979 , the pair split the company in half , with Walter and his son , Sam , agreeing to operate under the Merksamer Jewelery name . 
The sale of Merksamer Jewelers is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court . 
As earlier reported , L.J. Hooker this week received a $ 409 million bid for its three shopping malls , plus other properties from a consortium led by Honolulu real-estate investor Jay Shidler and A. Boyd Simpson , an Atlanta developer and former L.J. Hooker senior executive . 
The offer , which did n't include the Merksamer chain , is being reviewed by Mr. Sigoloff . 
Robert J. Regal was named president and chief executive officer of this company 's Universal-Rundle Corp. unit . 
Mr. Regal had been president and chief executive of RBS Industries Inc . 
Robert H. Carlson , previous president and chief executive of Universal-Rundle , will assume the title of chairman of the unit , a vitreous-china maker . 
The days may be numbered for animated shows featuring Alf , the Karate Kid and the Chipmunks . 
NBC , a leader in morning , prime-time and late night programs but an also-ran on Saturday mornings , when children rule the TV set , is contemplating getting out of the cartoon business . 
Instead , network officials say , it may `` counterprogram '' with shows for an audience that is virtually ignored in that time period : adults . 
`` There is talk of some revamping and we 're certainly heading in the direction of less and less animation , '' said Joseph S. Cicero , vice president of finance and administration for National Broadcasting Co. , a unit of General Electric Co . 
Mr. Cicero said that NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff , who declined to be interviewed , is `` looking at options now and may put some things into the schedule by mid-season . '' 
He declined to elaborate . 
NBC 's options could range from news-oriented programming to sports shows , although the network declined to comment . 
One major NBC affiliate , KCRA in Sacramento , plans to cancel the NBC Saturday morning line-up as of January and replace it with a local newscast . 
The one-hour program will be repeated with updates throughout Saturday mornings . 
`` We feel there is an opportunity for an audience that is not being served by any network , so we want to take the lead , '' says KCRA 's general manager , John Kueneke . 
`` We do n't need cartoons anymore . 
They only accounted for 5 % , at best , of the station 's total revenues . '' 
An NBC spokesman says the network will `` closely monitor '' the Sacramento situation , and says it is the only station to defect . 
Spokesmen for the television networks of CBS Inc. and Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. , say there are no plans to alter the children 's line-up on Saturday mornings . 
The youthful audience for Saturday programming is no longer dependent on the networks . 
There has been a surge in syndicated children 's shows to independent stations , as well as competition from videocassettes for kids and from cable outlets such as Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel . 
At the same time , there appears to be a market for news-oriented programming ; Turner Broadcasting System Inc. 's Cable News Network has its highest ratings , outside of prime time , on Saturday mornings . 
NBC has on previous occasions considered replacing cartoons with a Saturday version of `` Today , '' which is produced by NBC News . 
The network 's own production company , NBC Productions , supplies a half-hour family-oriented show titled `` Saved By The Bell . '' 
NBC Productions or NBC News could supply the network with other Saturday morning shows , a move that would control costs . 
Animated shows , which are made by outside production companies , cost the network about $ 300,000 per episode . 
Rohm & Haas Co. said third-quarter net income skidded 35 % to $ 32.6 million , or 49 cents a share . 
In the year-earlier quarter , the chemicals company had net of $ 49.8 million , or 75 cents a share . 
Sales were $ 623 million , up 0.5 % from $ 619.8 million a year ago . 
Rohm & Haas , which plans to start operating seven new production units this year , attributed the profit slide partly to higher start-up expense . 
The company also cited the stronger dollar , which cuts the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars . 
In addition , the company said , it was hurt by higher than previous-year costs for raw materials , though those costs have declined since the second quarter . 
Incrementally higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs , such as overtime pay . 
For the nine months , Rohm & Haas net totaled $ 155 million , or $ 2.33 a share , down 17 % from $ 187.8 million , or $ 2.82 a share , a year ago . 
Sales rose 5.2 % to $ 2.04 billion from $ 1.94 billion the previous year . 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Rohm & Haas closed at $ 33 a share , down $ 1.75 . 
Michael A. Gaskin , 55 years old , was named president and chief executive officer of this manufacturer of industrial robots , succeeding Walter K. Weisel . 
Mr. Weisel , 49 , resigned as president and chief executive and will work on special projects , said John J. Wallace , chairman . 
Mr. Gaskin formerly was president and chief executive of Taylor & Gaskin Inc. and was a director of Prab Robots since 1985 . 
Stephen N. Wertheimer was named managing director and group head of investment banking in Asia , based in Tokyo . 
Mr. Wertheimer , 38 years old , had been a first vice president in the industrial group in investment banking . 
He succeeds Everett Meyers , who resigned in May . 
This is written to correct a misquotation in your Oct. 3 article `` Deaths From Advanced Colon Cancer Can Be Reduced by Using Two Drugs . '' 
In this article , I was alleged to have said , `` Any patient with high-risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if he 's not getting this therapy . '' 
I did n't say this , and I 'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote . 
I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs , levamisole and 5-fluorouracil , to any of my colon-cancer patients . 
With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third -- but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer . 
This is not nearly good enough . 
I believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients , both today and tomorrow , should offer the hope of something better than that . 
My statement , read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the National Cancer Institute news conference , was the following : `` New clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results . 
These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better . 
I feel any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity . '' 
We have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead . 
This hope , however , will never be realized if we use levamisole and 5-fluorouracil as a stopping point .

The oil and auto industries , united in their dislike of President Bush 's proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels , announced a joint research program that could turn up a cleaner-burning gasoline . 
Officials of the Big Three auto makers and 14 petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most cost-effective fuel for reducing cities ' air-pollution problems , with no bias toward any fuel in particular . 
However , their search notably wo n't include natural gas or pure methanol -- the two front-running alternative fuels -- in tests to be completed by next summer . 
Instead , the tests will focus heavily on new blends of gasoline , which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is choking urban areas . 
Environmentalists criticized the program as merely a public-relations attempt to head off a White House proposal to require a million cars a year that run on cleaner-burning fuels by 1997 . 
While major oil companies have been experimenting with cleaner-burning gasoline blends for years , only Atlantic Richfield Co. is now marketing a lower-emission gasoline for older cars currently running on leaded fuel . 
The initial $ 11 million research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of reformulated gasolines , said Joe Colucci , head of fuels and lubricants at General Motors Corp. research laboratories . 
It will compare 21 different blends of gasolines with three mixtures of up to 85 % methanol . 
A second phase of research , which is still being planned , will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in 1992 or 1993 cars . 
There was no cost estimate for the second phase . 
`` The whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers , '' said Keith McHenry , a senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp . 
`` And we are looking for the most cost-effective way to clean up the air . '' 
But David Hawkins , an environmental lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council , said the research appears merely to be a way to promote reformulated gasoline . 
Oil and auto companies supported a move on Capitol Hill last week to gut Mr. Bush 's plans to require auto makers to begin selling alternative-fueled cars by 1995 . 
Instead , a House subcommittee adopted a clean-fuels program that specifically mentions reformulated gasoline as an alternative . 
The Bush administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes up a comprehensive clean-air bill . 
William Seidman , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , said Lincoln Savings & Loan Association should have been seized by the government in 1986 to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $ 2 billion . 
Mr. Seidman , who has been the nation 's top bank regulator , inherited the problems of Lincoln , based in Irvine , Calif. , after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law . 
He made his comments before House Banking Committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal-ridden industry . 
The inquiry also will cover the actions of Charles Keating Jr. , who is chairman of American Continental Corp. , Lincoln 's parent , and who contributed heavily to several U.S. senators . 
Mr. Seidman told the committee that the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency created to sell sick thrifts , has studied Lincoln 's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986 . 
`` My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions , we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations , '' Mr. Seidman said . 
When Lincoln was seized by the government , for example , 15 % of its loans , or $ 250 million , were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of American Continental 's 50 other subsidiaries , according to Mr. Seidman . 
But the government did n't step in until six months ago , when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship -- the day after American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors . 
The bankruptcy filing , the government has charged in a $ 1.1 billion civil lawsuit , was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company , which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals . 
The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court . 
`` I think it 's fairly clear -LCB- Mr. Keating -RCB- knew , '' that regulators were set to seize Lincoln , Mr. Seidman said . 
Further investigation , he said , may result in further actions against Lincoln 's executives , said Mr. Seidman , `` including fraud actions . '' 
Mr. Keating , for his part , has filed suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift . 
Leonard Bickwit , an attorney in Washington for Mr. Keating , declined to comment on the hearings , except to say , `` We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time . '' 
Lincoln 's treatment by former thrift regulators , in an agency disbanded by the new law , has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Mr. Keating . 
Mr. Seidman said yesterday , for example , that Sen. Dennis DeConcini -LRB- D. , Ariz. -RRB- , who received $ 48,100 in contributions from Mr. Keating , phoned Mr. Seidman to request that he push for a sale of Lincoln before it would be seized . 
After the government lawsuit was filed against Lincoln , Sen. DeConcini returned the campaign contributions . 
The senator 's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because `` hundreds of Arizona jobs -LCB- at Lincoln -RCB- were on the line . '' 
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle -LRB- D. , Mich . -RRB- has also returned contributions he received from Mr. Keating a year ago . 
Sens. John Glenn -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- , John McCain , -LRB- R. , Ariz. -RRB- and Alan Cranston -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- also received substantial contributions from Mr. Keating and sought to intervene on behalf of Lincoln . 
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- said Sen. Cranston volunteered to appear before the House committee , if necessary . 
But a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators . 
At the hearing , Mr. Seidman said the RTC has already pumped $ 729 million into Lincoln for liquidity . 
He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of $ 225 million in American Continental subordinated debt . 
Some of those debtholders have filed a suit , saying they believed they were buying government-insured certificates of deposit . 
`` We have no plans at this time to pay off those notes , '' he said . 
Eastern Airlines ' creditors committee , unhappy with the carrier 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings , asked its own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization . 
Representatives of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman , Sachs & Co. , hired by creditors to consult on Eastern 's financial plans , told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that Eastern 's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors ' approval . 
According to one person present at the meeting , Eastern 's new plan is financially `` overly optimistic . '' 
Asked about the consultants ' reports , an Eastern spokeswoman said `` we totally disagree . '' 
She said they have `` oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely off-base . '' 
At a later news conference here , Frank Lorenzo , chairman of Eastern 's parent Texas Air Corp. , said Eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year , operating with more service than it originally had scheduled . 
He insisted , as he has before , that creditors would be paid in full under the plan . 
Mr. Lorenzo made no mention of creditors ' negative response to his plan . 
`` We 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly , '' Mr. Lorenzo told reporters . 
`` We 're meeting and surpassing our goals , '' he added . 
In July , Eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for Eastern to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size . 
But after selling off pieces such as its East Coast shuttle , its Philadelphia hub and various planes , Eastern hit a stumbling block . 
It could n't sell its South American routes , one of the major assets marked for disposal . 
Those routes , valued by the creditors ' professionals at about $ 400 million , were to be sold to AMR Corp. 's American Airlines . 
A last-minute snag in negotiations with AMR , over an unrelated lawsuit between American and another Texas Air unit , caused the deal to collapse . 
Eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself , which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization . 
It also would leave Eastern a bigger carrier than the scaled-down one proposed under the initial plan . 
Those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped . 
Since then , Eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions , but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions . 
The committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze Eastern 's plans . 
Both said the new plan would n't work . 
Ernst & Young said Eastern 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest , tax and depreciation by $ 100 million , and that Eastern 's plan presented no comfort level , according to a source present at yesterday 's session . 
Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated Eastern would miss the same mark by $ 120 million to $ 135 million , the source said . 
The experts said they expected Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated . 
Other costs also would increase , including maintenance , because Eastern has an older fleet . 
At the news conference , Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes presented a far rosier assessment . 
Flanked by flight attendants , pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms , they said Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats . 
Starting next month , Eastern will begin flying 775 flights daily instead of the previously announced 700 , they said . 
Mr. Bakes declined to give out Eastern 's daily losses , but said he did n't expect Eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow . 
These accounts hold several hundred million dollars , primarily from asset sales . 
The plan Eastern hopes to pursue , he said , calls for Eastern to have $ 390 million in cash by year 's end . 
Both he and Mr. Lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in January . 
As to negotiations with creditors , Mr. Lorenzo said in remarks after the conference `` we 'll have to see how they -LCB- talks -RCB- come along . '' 
However , he added , `` it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors . 
It must be accepted by the court . '' 
Under bankruptcy law , Eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan . 
That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again . 
If Eastern can get creditor support , court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift . 
But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan , or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own . 
In any event , some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes . 
Eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March 4 . 
Mr. Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85 % to 90 % of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern . 
He projected it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring , only slightly fewer than the carrier 's old volume of 1,050 a day . 
HOPES OF SIMPLIFYING the corporate minimum tax before 1990 are weakening . 
The method of calculating the 20 % tax , paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way , is due for a change in 1990 , thanks to 1986 's tax act . 
But most experts agree that the concept that is to be introduced drags in great complexity ; they have been trying to head it off this year . 
Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski backed a simplification plan in the pending House tax bill , but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser . 
Now the Senate 's stripped-down bill omits any proposal to deal with the corporate tax . 
Proponents of simplification fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are waning . 
`` We hear it has low priority on the House side , '' says Samuel Starr of Coopers & Lybrand , CPAs . 
If the law is n't changed , he says , `` we are left staring at rules that are almost impossible to implement , because there are so many complex depreciation calculations to do . '' 
But Congress still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next , Starr adds . 
HUGO 'S RAVAGES may be offset by immediate claims for tax refunds . 
This law aids hurricane-wracked locales named by the president as disaster areas , as well as regions so designated after other 1989 disasters . 
It lets victims elect to deduct casualty losses on either 1989 or amended 1988 returns , whichever offers the larger tax benefit ; they have until April 16 to choose . 
Amending a 1988 return to claim a refund brings cash faster ; but for personal losses , there are other factors to consider , notes publisher Prentice Hall . 
A loss -- after insurance recoveries -- is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds $ 100 and that the year 's total losses exceed 10 % of adjusted gross income ; victims may pick the year when income is lower and deductions higher . 
In filing an original -LRB- not amended -RRB- return , a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether one spouse has larger income ; that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately . 
THE IRS DELAYS several deadlines for Hugo 's victims . 
Returns for 1988 from people with six-month filing extensions were due Monday , but the IRS says people in the disaster areas wo n't be penalized for late filing if their returns are marked `` Hugo '' and postmarked by Jan. 16 . 
Interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes , but late-payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is 10 % or less of the liability . 
IRS Notice 89-136 describes this and other deadline relief for Hugo 's victims . 
Among the provisions : Fiscal-year taxpayers with returns due last Monday wo n't be penalized if they file -- or request an extension -- and pay tax due by Nov. 15 . 
Excise-tax returns due by Oct. 31 or Nov. 30 may be delayed to Jan. 16 . 
Extensions ca n't be granted for filing employment-tax returns due Oct. 31 or for depositing withheld taxes , but late penalties will be abated for deposits made by Nov. 15 . 
The notice also grants relief for certain estate-tax returns . 
ONE-DAY JAUNTS in a chartered boat were perks for permanent staffers of American Business Service Corp. , a Costa Mesa , Calif. , supplier of temporary workers . 
The IRS denied cost deductions because few of the temps got to go aboard . 
But the Tax Court said the limitations were reasonable and realistic and allowed the deductions .

BIGGER THAN A BREADBOX was this cash hoarder 's reputation for honesty . 
People often cite frugality and distrust of banks to justify cash caches to the IRS . 
Gregory Damonne Brown of Fremont , Calif. , a hardworking , reclusive young bachelor , told that story to the Tax Court . 
But judges usually find the real aim is to escape tax on hidden income ; and the IRS said Brown must have had such income -- although it uncovered no source -- because he deposited $ 124,732 in a bank account in 1982-84 while reporting income of only $ 52,012 . 
Brown 's story : 
The deposits came from savings kept in a Tupperware breadbox ; he saved $ 47,000 in 1974-81 by living with family members and pinching pennies and $ 45,000 of secret gifts from his remorseful father , who had abandoned the family in 1955 . 
Brown had no proof ; but testimony of his mother and stepmother about his father and of an ex-employer about his honesty and habits satisfied a judge that Brown was truthful and his tale of gifts was possible . 
The IRS offered no evidence of hidden sources of taxable income , so Judge Shields rejected its claims . 
BRIEFS : 
Asked how he made charitable gifts of $ 26,350 out of reported two-year income of $ 46,892 , Thomas H. McFall of Bryan , Texas , told the Tax Court he had understated his income . 
The court rejected his incredible claims , denied his deductions , and imposed a negligence penalty ... .

Kay Peterson mounts her bicycle and grinds up yet another steep , rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain goats . 
After a tortuous climb , she is rewarded by a picture-postcard vista : a glade of golden aspens under an azure Indian-summer sky . 
This place is 12 miles into the back country -- a day-long trudge for a hiker , but reached by Ms. Peterson and six others in a mere two hours of pedaling fat-tired mountain bikes . 
`` This , '' says Ms. Peterson , `` is what it 's all about . '' 
Twelve hundred miles away , rangers at a Napa County , Calif. , state park are among the many who do n't quite share the enthusiasm . 
This summer , speeding bikers were blamed for an accident in the Napa County park , in which a horse -- spooked on a trail that was closed to bikers -- broke its leg . 
The animal had to be destroyed ; the bikers fled and were never found . 
In numerous parks near San Francisco , rangers have been forced to close trails , set up speed traps and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding . 
They have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained they were being driven from trails . 
`` We were being overrun , '' says Steve Fiala , trails coordinator of the East Bay Regional Park District . 
Two years ago , the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its 65,000 hilly acres . 
From about 200,000 six years ago , the number of mountain bikes in the U.S. is expected to grow to 10 million in 1990 . 
At least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone . 
The controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all-terrain bicycles is one of the most divisive storms to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory . 
Bikers -- many of them ardent environmentalists -- proclaim their sport an efficient , safe , fitness-promoting way to get back to nature , while asserting a right , as taxpayers , to pedal on public lands . 
But the bikes ' burgeoning numbers , safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas , from the Sierras to the Eastern Seaboard , to ban them from the back country . 
Key to the issue is that the bikes , in skillful hands , can go virtually anywhere , and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror . 
An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance . 
Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour -- a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians . 
For harried public-land managers across the nation , the response is increasingly to shut the gates . 
The state of California , following the lead of some regional parks , recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles . 
The move largely consigns them to roads used by motorized vehicles . 
Most other states have enacted similar bans . 
The bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks . 
Even the U.S. Forest Service , whose lenient `` multiple-use '' philosophy permits motorized vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the U.S. , has begun to close some lands to the bikes , including major portions of the popular Pacific Crest Trail , which stretches from California to Canada . 
Often these closings come after vigorous anti-bike lobbying by conservation organizations , the politically potent Sierra Club among them . 
Sierra has been instrumental in securing a number of the California bans . 
It has been waging an all-out campaign to beat back a proposal , pushed by Utah bike groups , to allow the cycles in federally designated wilderness areas , where they are now prohibited . 
Yet Sierra 's hard-line stance has created something of a rift in the organization , which estimates that 17 % of its 500,000 members own mountain bikes . 
Pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti-bike rhetoric ; it no longer , for example , lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain-marring off-road vehicles . 
But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes wo n't injure the environment or other users . 
`` I have a mountain bike , yet as a hiker I 've been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them , '' says Gene Coan , an official at Sierra 's headquarters in San Francisco , echoing the concerns of many members . 
`` People who feel that cyclists should be banned from an area are n't looking at the whole picture , '' complains Mark Langton , associate editor of Mountain and City Biking magazine in Canoga Park , Calif . 
Mr. Langton is among the legions of bikers who got their first taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers . 
He says fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as hikers ; many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy . 
To fight back , activists such as Mr. Langton are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails . 
Mr. Langton 's group , Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association , mounted petition drives to help keep open certain Santa Monica Mountain trails designated for closing . 
Biking groups in Montana , Idaho , Michigan and Massachusetts have won similar concessions , says Tim Blumenthal , mountain bike editor of Bicycling magazine . 
These groups have been trying to improve the mountain biker 's image ; in the San Francisco-area park district where a ranger was clobbered by a cyclist this summer bikers have formed a volunteer patrol to help rangers enforce regulations , and to school riders in proper trail etiquette . 
Even staunch anti-bike Sierra members concede that 10 % of all riders cause most of the problems . 
While some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations , much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through `` education and peer pressure , '' says Jim Hasenauer , a director of the International Mountain Biking Association . 
`` I think we 're making progress . '' 
Few would have foreseen such a furor when , a decade ago , some Marin County bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike using fat tires , lightweight metallurgy and multi-gear technology . 
They wanted a machine that would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles . 
They got a machine more responsive , more stable and in many ways easier to ride than the thin-tired racing bikes that then were the rage . 
When the bikes first entered mass production in 1981 , they were dismissed as a fad . 
Last year , 25 % of the 10 million bicycles sold in the U.S. were mountain bikes . 
In California , a bellwether market , they accounted for more than 80 % of all bike sales . 
The majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country . 
City dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic , bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes . 
Crested Butte , population 1,200 , is a bastion of the sport . 
By one estimate , everyone here under 50 owns at least one bike . 
The town is home to the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and it hosts the annual Fat Tire Bike Week . 
This summer , the jamboree attracted more visitors than the busiest week of the town 's winter ski season . 
David Lindsey , chairman of the Fat Tire Bike celebration , muses that the bike 's popularity may be a combination of technology and nostalgia . 
`` The mountain bike feels as comfortable as the ` paperboy ' bike you had as a kid , but it can do so much more , '' he says .

Stock-market tremors again shook bond prices , while the dollar turned in a mixed performance . 
Early yesterday , investors scrambled to buy Treasury bonds for safety as stock prices plummeted and fears mounted of a replay of Friday . 
But stocks later recovered , erasing most of their early declines . 
That cut short the rally in Treasury bonds and depressed prices moderately below late Monday 's levels . 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average , down more than 60.25 points early in the day , finished 18.65 points lower at 2638.73 . 
Long-term Treasury issues declined about half a point , or $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount . 
`` The stock market clearly is leading the bond markets , '' said Jack Conlon , an executive vice president at Nikko Securities . 
`` People are breathing a major sigh of relief that the world did n't end Monday morning '' or yesterday . 
Gold , a closely watched barometer of investor anxiety , was little changed . 
The dollar initially fell against other major currencies on news that the U.S. trade deficit surged in August to $ 10.77 billion . 
But the dollar later rebounded , finishing slightly higher against the yen although slightly lower against the mark . 
Federal Reserve officials sent another signal of their determination to shore up investor confidence . 
In an apparent attempt to keep a lid on short-term interest rates , the Fed once again pumped money into the banking system . 
But the Fed move was a small gesture , traders said . 
Fed officials appear reluctant to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move does n't appear necessary , several investment managers said . 
The Fed has allowed a key short-term interest rate to decline about one-quarter percentage point . 
The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks has been hovering around 8 3\/4 % , down from 9 % previously . 
Although stocks have led bonds this week , some traders predict that relationship will reverse during the next few weeks . 
Nikko 's Mr. Conlon fears a huge wave of Treasury borrowing early next month will drive down Treasury bond prices . 
That , coupled with poor third-quarter corporate-earnings comparisons , `` will make trouble for the equity market for the next two to three months , '' he says . 
But several other traders contend investors have overreacted to junk-bond jitters , and that stock prices will continue to recover . 
`` They shot the whole orchestra just because the piano player hit a bad note , '' said Laszlo Birinyi , president of Birinyi Associates Inc. , referring to the stock market 's plunge Friday on news of trouble in financing the UAL Corp . buy-out .

Weyerhaeuser Co. reported a one-time gain and strong wood-product sales that offset weakness in pulp and paper to fuel a 15 % jump in third-quarter net income to $ 166.8 million , or 78 cents a share . 
In the 1988 third quarter , the forest-products company reported profit of $ 144.9 million , or 69 cents a share . 
Sales rose 9 % to $ 2.57 billion from $ 2.36 billion . 
For the nine months , the company posted a 14 % rise in profit to $ 469.8 million , or $ 2.21 a share , from $ 410.3 million , or $ 1.95 a share . 
Sales rose 9 % to $ 7.54 billion from $ 6.95 billion . 
Results for the 1989 third quarter and nine months include a pretax loss of $ 33 million from the company 's business improvement and refocusing program , and a gain of $ 49 million on the sale of a subsidiary 's common stock . 
Forest-products operations strengthened in the third quarter , while paper operations were dogged by higher costs , soft newsprint exports and a strong Japanese yen . 
Some competing forest-products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business . 
Weyerhaeuser 's pulp and paper operations were up for the nine months , but full-year performance depends on the balance of operating and maintenance costs , plus pricing of certain products , the company said . 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter , the company said export log and lumber markets will be weak , while panel and plywood markets will be stronger . 
Pulp and paper performance depends on cost and price variables , the company said . 
Bankers Trust New York Corp. became the latest major U.S. bank to increase reserves for its loans to less-developed countries , making a $ 1.6 billion third-quarter addition to its provision . 
The bank also said it expects to report a $ 1.42 billion loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year . 
The new reserves bring the company 's provision for loans to Third World countries to $ 2.6 billion , or 85 % of Bankers Trust 's medium and long-term loans to these countries . 
`` Step up to the plate and take the big swing . 
Get the problem behind you and do n't look back , '' said James J. McDermott , analyst at Keefe , Bruyette & Woods , in approving of the move . 
Bankers Trust `` has had the capacity to do this for some time , '' the analyst said . 
He expects Citicorp to take a similar step this year . 
Citicorp yesterday reported a 9 % third-quarter earnings drop , which analysts called a bit disappointing , while Manufacturers Hanover Corp. posted a $ 789 million loss for the quarter after adding $ 950 million to its reserve for loans to less-developed countries . 
Three other major U.S. banks posted earnings increases . 
Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco posted a 17 % jump . 
PNC Financial Corp. , the parent of Pittsburgh National Bank , reported net income climbed 9.8 % , while net for Banc One Corp. of Columbus , Ohio , grew 3.8 % . 
Citicorp 
Analysts were only slightly disappointed by Citicorp 's numbers . 
`` There 's nothing in here that 's horrible and nothing to make you think they 're setting the world on fire , '' said Carole Berger , analyst for C.J. Lawrence , Morgan Grenfell Inc . 
Earnings from the bank 's global consumer business grew 27 % . 
`` The consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream , '' said Mr. McDermott of Keefe , Bruyette & Woods . 
Corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were `` relatively flat , sometimes choppy , '' the bank said , and profit for the area sank 27 % . 
The cross-border loan portfolio reflected `` adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns , '' the bank said no interest payments from Argentina in the nine months and none from Brazil in the third quarter , while Venezuela brought itself `` substantially current . '' 
Overall , the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $ 70 million from $ 80 million a year earlier . 
`` People were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision '' for medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries , a Citicorp spokesman said . 
But he reiterated the bank 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of $ 2.6 billion , covering about 30 % of the $ 8.9 billion of such loans outstanding . 
Ronald I. Mandle , analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. , called Citicorp 's venture-capital gains of $ 93 million before taxes `` strong . '' 
A `` concerning '' item the analyst cited was the 10 % jump in expenses , which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business . 
Citicorp 's spokesman said , however , that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth . 
Wells Fargo 
Wells Fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks , minimizing a drop in net interest margin with 13 % third-quarter growth in high-yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages . 
Its margin fell only seven basis points , or 7\/100ths of a percentage point , from a year ago , compared with a 13-point drop at Security Pacific Corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country . 
As a result , Wells Fargo 's net interest income rose $ 36.3 million , or 7 % , to $ 537 million for the quarter . 
Non-interest income fell slightly to $ 191.9 million from $ 193.3 million , while Wells Fargo continued to rigorously control non-interest expense , which was almost flat at $ 393.4 million . 
The combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave Wells Fargo a 1.25 % return on average assets for the quarter , about 40 % higher than Security Pacific 's and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the U.S. . 
Wells Fargo 's return on equity increased to 24.4 % from 23.8 % . 
Wells Fargo has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less-developed countries , and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans , which fell 8 % from the previous quarter to $ 806.8 million from $ 880.9 million . 
But the amount was still 39 % higher than the year-ago level , and 25 % higher as a percentage of total loans . 
That trend , and Wells Fargo 's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs , are about the only worries analysts have about Wells Fargo 's financial picture . 
Wells Fargo is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve , which increased to $ 711 million at Sept. 30 from $ 664 million the previous quarter but was down from $ 852 million a year ago , when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans . 
Manufacturers Hanover 
Manufacturers Hanover said that excluding the addition to its reserves , certain tax benefits , and a one-time $ 16 million gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company , third-quarter earnings were $ 75 million . 
The comparable year-earlier number was $ 56 million , a spokesman said . 
The bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $ 2.4 billion , covering 36 % of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations . 
The net interest margin - the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in the quarter , as did certain areas of wholesale banking . 
Fees from syndicating loans dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million . 
`` We did n't take part in a lot of deals '' in the quarter `` because their credit quality was poor , '' the spokesman said . 
Expenses unrelated to interest rose 5.4 % , to $ 541 million . 
PNC Financial 
PNC Financial cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said it continues to cut costs . 
Net interest income in the third quarter edged up 1.4 % , to $ 317.7 million . 
Trust income grew 15 % , to $ 49.9 million , while service charges , fees and commissions increased 22 % , to $ 79.4 million . 
The bank 's total allowance for credit losses was $ 502.1 million , or 1.82 % of total loans . 
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party control of the government . 
Other analysts say the Indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties . 
Elections in this large , diverse and passionate nation are always hard to predict . 
Much depends on the opposition , a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former Gandhi cabinet minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh . 
The biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against Mr. Gandhi and his five years in power -- five years of ups and downs , promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity . 
Yesterday , four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party , Mr. Gandhi called elections for the lower house of Parliament on Nov. 22 and 24 . 
The elections will be held in different states on one of the two days . 
-LRB- The lower house 's five-year term expires in January ; the Parliament 's upper house is appointed . -RRB- 
The elections will be a rigorous test for the 45-year-old prime minister and Congress -LRB- I -RRB- , which in various forms has ruled for 40 of India 's 42 years of independence . 
After a landslide win in 1984 in polls held after the assassination of his mother , Indira Gandhi , Mr. Gandhi saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride . 
His early promises to make India a modern nation remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy . 
His pledge to clean up local administration and Indian politics , including his own party , went unfulfilled . 
His `` Mr. Clean '' image was muddied by an arms-kickback scandal , which will be a major campaign issue . 
Some analysts predict that disappointment in Mr. Gandhi 's spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy-handed local government will crest at the polls . 
`` There 's a wide feeling of indignation across the country , '' says Bhabani Sen Gupta of the Center for Policy Research , in New Delhi . 
`` I think the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman , by a corrupt revenue collector . 
This could be a big protest against an administrative failure . '' 
Even if the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- retains control of the government , Mr. Gandhi 's ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority . 
Economic analysts call his trail-blazing liberalization of the Indian economy incomplete , and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned firmly to power . 
The Lok Sabha , or lower house of Parliament , has 542 elected and two appointed seats . 
In 1984 , the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- captured 405 seats , the largest victory in the history of Indian democracy . 
The landslide was fueled by panic that prevailed in India at the time . 
Mrs. Gandhi had been assassinated by separatist Sikhs , and many Indians feared their country might split apart . 
In the previous three general elections , similar national issues clinched the vote . 
In 1971 , the Congress Party won after India 's victory in the Bangladesh war . 
In 1977 , Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of office after her 19-month emergency rule , and in 1980 , after her successors made a mess of their three years in power , she was restored to office . 
Most political analysts say that if Mr. Gandhi 's opposition unites to field single candidates in most precincts , the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- will lose big . 
But if the opposition remains fractured , the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- could win a small majority , or lead a coalition government . 
Chimanbhai Mehta , a parliamentarian and former Gandhi ally , predicts Congress -LRB- I -RRB- will win only 150 seats , a quarter of the house , if the opposition fields single candidates in 80 % of the races . 
Analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to unite , and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates . 
The arms-kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign , but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average Indian voters . 
In 1986 , India signed a $ 1.4 billion contract with AB Bofors , a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB , to purchase 400 artillery pieces . 
The contract was negotiated by the countries ' two prime ministers , and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents ' costs . 
In April 1987 , evidence surfaced that commissions were paid . 
The opposition charged that the money was used to bribe Indian government officials , an allegation denied by Mr. Gandhi 's administration . 
But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence . 
The scandal has faded and flared , but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages , and that has helped galvanize the opposition , which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills . 
It was the first time in 20 years that such government bills were defeated . 
In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone , a job , and even into a school , the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government . 
That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi , whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power . 
His term has produced no spectacular failures in politics , in the economy or on the military front , and has chalked up some successes . 
But the average Indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt . 
His failures in those two areas deeply , and sometimes bitterly , disappointed many Indians . 
`` We do n't like the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- , '' says Sooraji Jath , a farmer in the western state of Gujarat . 
`` The Congress government is taking the farmers ' bread and not giving us any support . 
When there are well problems , light problems , road problems , the government tells us to forget it . '' 
The greatest thing going for Mr. Gandhi and the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party is the poor reputation of the opposition . 
Even if it unites for the elections , its coherence is likely to be temporary . 
When the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- lost the 1977 election , following Mrs. Gandhi 's hated emergency rule , a similar coalition took power and then disintegrated . 
Many Indians fear a repeat of that experience . 
March 24 , 1986 : 
AB Bofors , a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB , enters into a $ 1.4 billion contract with India 's Defense Ministry to supply 400 Bofors FH-77B 155-mm field howitzer guns . 
In 1985 , Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi , in his talks with then Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme , imposed the condition that the contract have no middlemen . 
April 16 , 1987 : 
Swedish National Radio reports that about $ 40 million -- nearly 3 % of the total contract -- was paid by Bofors as commissions to middlemen . 
June 1 , 1987 : 
Sweden 's National Audit Bureau releases its report confirming payment of about $ 40 million to unidentified Indians . 
The report says that investigations were severely hampered by lack of cooperation from Bofors . 
Bofors says it ca n't disclose the names of the middlemen because it would jeopardize industrial confidentiality . 
A portion of the report containing names of the middlemen is withheld by officials citing bank secrecy requirements . 
Aug. 6 , 1987 : 
Prime Minister Gandhi tells the Indian Parliament , `` ... neither I nor any member of my family has received any consideration in these transactions . 
That is the truth . '' 
Aug. 26 , 1987 : 
Bofors admits payments of $ 41 million to middlemen . 
April 22 , 1988 : 
The Hindu newspaper publishes facsimiles of bank documents for foreign-exchange remittances and letters between Bofors and certain private companies related to the sale of the guns to India . 
April 26 , 1988 : 
A parliamentary investigative committee dominated by the Congress -LRB- I -RRB- Party concludes that there were no middlemen in the deal and no payment to any Indian individual or company . 
July 18 , 1989 : 
The comptroller and auditor-general of India reports serious lapses in the government 's technical and financial evaluation of the Bofors deal . 
Sept. 15 , 1989 : 
Retired army Chief of Staff Krishnaswami Sundarji discloses in an interview that he suggested in May 1987 that the government cancel the Bofors contract . 
According to Gen. Sundarji , that would have forced Bofors to disclose the names of the middlemen who received kickbacks from the company . 
His recommendation was rejected by the government . 
Oct. 9. 1989 : 
The Hindu newspaper publishes the withheld portion of the Swedish National Audit Bureau 's report . 
The disclosures state that commissions were paid by Bofors to an Indian agent of the arms company . 
Parsow Partnership Ltd. and Elkhorn Partners L.P. said they may seek proposals from third parties relating to a sale or restructuring of CACI International Inc . 
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Parsow and Elkhorn , which together hold 8.685 % of CACI 's common shares , said they think it is in the best interest of CACI stockholders that the company be sold . 
CACI , based in Arlington , Va. , said it had n't seen the filing by Parsow and Elkhorn and therefore had no comment . 
The partnerships said they may seek board representation , and they may seek the support of CACI 's board and other major shareholders in connection with their plans . 
According to the filing , Parsow and Elkhorn are based in Elkhorn , Neb. , and are controlled by the same general partner , Alan S. Parsow . 
Their combined stake consists of 880,500 CACI common shares , including 86,500 shares bought in the past 60 days at $ 2.3125 to $ 2.4375 a share . 
Additional shares may be bought or sold in the open market , in private transactions or otherwise , depending on market conditions and other factors . 
The inverse trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted yesterday as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices . 
But bond investors continue to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market . 
In early trading , investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that Friday 's stock market debacle would be repeated . 
But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which had been down more than 60 points in midmorning , dashed those expectations . 
Treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $ 4 billion offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt . 
`` Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall , '' said Roger Early , a vice president at Federated Investors Inc. , Pittsburgh . 
`` When stocks stabilized , that was a disappointment . '' 
Meanwhile , for the second straight day , the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve 's open market operations . 
Fed officials injected more cash into the banking system by arranging $ 1.5 billion of repurchase agreements during the usual pre-noon intervention period . 
The move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence . 
`` The intervention has been friendly , meaning that they really did n't have to do it , '' said Maria Fiorini Ramirez , money-market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . 
She said a more aggressive move was n't needed . 
The Fed also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further . 
It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline 1\/4 percentage point to about 8 3\/4 % from its previous target level of about 9 % . 
The rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy . 
It ended at about 8 11\/16 % yesterday , but was as low as 8 1\/2 % Monday . 
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 1\/2 point , or over $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount , while the yield moved above 8 % for the first time since Thursday . 
Investment-grade corporate , municipal and mortgage-backed securities also fell . 
But most junk bonds closed unchanged after opening slightly higher on bargain-hunting by institutional investors . 
Some so-called high-quality junk issues , such as R.H. Macy & Co. 's 14 1\/2 % subordinated debentures , rose . 
The Macy 's issue closed up about one point at a bid price of 97 . 
The TVA 's public debt offering was its first in 15 years . 
Strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion . 
Traders said hedging related to the TVA pricing also pressured Treasury bonds . 
`` Underwriters of the TVA bonds reduced their market risk by selling Treasurys to cover at least part of their -LCB- TVA -RCB- holdings , '' said James R. Capra , a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc . 
The TVA bonds also `` served to remind the market that there will be even more new supply , '' said Lawrence N. Leuzzi , a managing director at S.G. Warburg Securities & Co . 
Today the Treasury will announce the size of its next two-year note sale and Resolution Funding Corp. will announce details of its first bond offering . 
Some traders estimate $ 9.75 billion of new two-year Treasurys will be sold next week , and they expect Refcorp to offer $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion of long-term `` bailout '' bonds . 
Refcorp was created to help fund the thrift bailout . 
Another agency issue came to market yesterday . 
The Office of Finance of the Federal Home Loan Banks said it priced a four-part $ 2.27 billion bond offering for the banks to yield from 8.125 % to 8.375 % . 
The release of several economic reports had little impact on the market , including a report that the U.S. trade deficit expanded to a surprisingly wide $ 10.77 billion in August , up from a revised $ 8.24 billion in July . 
The August gap was expected to have expanded to $ 9.1 billion . 
Treasury Securities 
Treasury securities were essentially flat to about 1\/2 point lower . 
The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 100 28\/32 to yield 8.04 % , compared with 101 19\/32 to yield 7.97 % Monday . 
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 99 25\/32 to yield 8.01 % , compared with 100 1\/32 to yield 7.97 % . 
Short-term rates increased . 
The discount rate on three-month bills rose to 7.52 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75 % . 
The rate on six-month bills rose to 7.53 % for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.92 % . 
Corporate , Other Issues 
Investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1\/4 to 1\/2 point lower , while most junk bonds ended unchanged . 
The TVA 's huge $ 4 billion offering dominated attention in the new-issue market . 
TVA offered $ 2 billion of 30-year bonds priced to yield 9.06 % ; $ 1 billion in 10-year notes priced to yield 8.42 % ; and $ 1 billion in five-year notes priced to yield 8.33 % . 
The TVA , which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems , is a corporation wholly owned by the U.S. government . 
Yesterday 's bond sale was part of a $ 6.7 billion refinancing plan to pay off high-interest debt the TVA owes the Federal Financing Bank , an arm of the Treasury . 
Meanwhile , Lockheed Corp. priced a $ 300 million note offering to yield 9.39 % . 
Mortgage-Backed Securities 
The derivative mortgage-backed market revived after a brief hiatus as two new Remics totaling $ 850 million were offered and talk circulated about two more issues that could be priced today . 
The revival of the real estate mortgage investment conduit market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after two days of volatile trading . 
Dealers noted that it 's difficult to structure new Remics when prices are moving widely . 
The two Remics priced were a $ 500 million Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issue underwritten by Salomon Brothers Inc. and a $ 350 million Federal National Mortgage Association deal underwritten by Greenwich Capital Markets . 
The Remic issuance supported prices of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities , which held up better than Government National Mortgage Association securities during an afternoon sell-off . 
Ginnie Mae 9 % securities for November delivery ended at 97 29\/32 , down 7\/32 ; 9 1\/2 % securities at 99 31\/32 , down 6\/32 ; and 10 % securities at 101 29\/32 , down 5\/32 . 
Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 5\/32 , down 3\/32 . 
The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.43 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note held at 1.42 percentage points . 
Municipals 
Confusion over the near-term trend for rates dominated the municipal arena , as gyrations in the stock market continued to buffet bonds . 
Long tax-exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to 3\/8 point lower after a whipsaw session of moving inversely to stocks in modest dealer-led trading . 
Prices of pre-refunded municipal bonds were capped by news that Chemical Securities Inc. , as agent for a customer , will accept bids today for two large lists of bonds that include many such issues . 
The lists total $ 654.5 million .
