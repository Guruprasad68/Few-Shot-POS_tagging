WISER stands for World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility . 
WISER sets out to document , link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement , online philanthropy marketplaces . 
This is , of course , to philanthropy what eBay and Amazon are to commerce . 
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy . says they need . 
Take a look at Changing the Present , started by a TEDster , next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present or foundation . 
There are now , today , so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal , . 
These funds are to philanthropy what venture capital , private equity , and eventually mutual funds are to investing , but with a twist -- because often the mash-up , if you will , of these things , in the future , when these things come together in the experiments of the future -- imagine that 's stated . 
I 'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories , which are innovation , competitions and social investing . 
They 're or scientific solution . 
That leaves the final category , social investing , which is really , anyway , the biggest of them all , represented here by equity for social enterprise . 
So we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital the big givers do n't yet fulfill this aspiration , I think this is the new zeitgeist : open , big , fast , connected , and , let . 
And I 'm hopeful because it 's not only philanthropy that 's reorganizing itself , it 's also whole other portions of the social sector , and `` philanthroentrepreneur , '' and `` venture philanthropy '' . 
We do n't have a language for it yet . 
Whatever we call it , it 's converge and come together to create , really , a shockingly new reality . 
It may be that the social singularity ahead is the one that we fear our hands as never before . 
The question is , is there a positive social singularity ? 
Is there a frontier for us of how we live need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible . 
That 's why I have one always felt a mystical connection to these two men , both of whom I never knew . 
And so , in their honor , I want to offer or god-child , is looking at this photograph of you . 
What is the story you most want for them to tell ? 
Thank you very much 
And now , for every two men who get a college degree , three women will do the same . 
Women , for the first time this year a place where women are more successful than men , believe it or not , and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture -- what our , who is a parody of American manhood , and that 's what we have in our commercials today . 
The phrase `` first-born son '' is so 
If you think about this , if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots , you can see the evidence everywhere great progress with women . 
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind . 
But the difference is that , back then , it was driven it or not , and that 's why I talk about the `` end of men '' . 
Now all you men out there , this is not if we do take account of it , then I think it will go much more smoothly . 
I first started thinking about this about a year and in which she described how hard the recession had hit men , and I started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession to women . 
And now look at this second set of slides . 
These are headlines about what 's been going on with women in the next men . 
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm . 
They were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to this finding , to do a nationwide survey . 
So they spread out all the census data , and what they found , the guy described to me have n't explained to you why this is happening . 
And in a moment , I 'm going to show you a graph , and what you 'll jobs -- and that the middle , the middle-skill jobs , and the middle-earning jobs , are starting to drop out of the economy . 
This has been 
So watch that . You see them both drop out of the middle class . 
Watch what happens to the women . Watch what happens to the 
What it 's about is that the economy has changed a lot . 
We used to have a manufacturing economy , which was about building goods and you had a specific set of skills , and with the help of a union , you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life . 
But that to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be , and those are things that women do extremely well , as we 're read management books now , a leader is somebody who can foster creativity , who can get his -- get the employees -- see , I still say `` all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home . 
So that 's childcare , elder see what 's going to happen , you ca n't just look at the workforce that is now , you have to look at our future workforce . just very uncomfortable doing that . 
They 're used to thinking of themselves as providers , and they ca n't seem to build the social networks that allow whatever reason , are doing worse in school than very young girls , and people have theories about that . 
Is it because we have an excessively verbal so I do n't have the answer . 
But in the mean time , I 'm going to call on the worldwide education expert , who 's my 
Noah : Why ? They were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely . 
HR : So there you go . . 
Basically , the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day , that their husband would maybe have a I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history do n't reverse themselves without a lot of pain , and that 's why their jobs after the housing boom , and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support . 
And the instructor was up did was he wrote down on the board `` $ 85,000 , '' and he said , `` That 's her salary , '' and then he wrote down can be pretty painful , and we really have to work through it . 
And the other reason it 's kind of urgent is because it 's not 
And here 's my favorite example , which is in South Korea . 
Over several decades , South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know wanted to rapidly industrialize , and so what they did was , they started to push women into the workforce . 
Now they 've been asking a question 's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways , where you can see that the stereotypes are changing have our Bud Light guy who 's the happy couch potato . 
And then here 's a shocker : even America 's most sexiest man alive , the can hold a gun these days . 
And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we 've got these uber-exaggerated images into something this glass ceiling . 
And we 're always below the glass ceiling , the women . 
And we have a lot of skill and experience , but definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge , but it 's also pretty exhilarating , because it 's beautiful up there , and you 're 
You can bring your husband along . 
You can bring your friends , or your colleagues , or your babysitter to walk along with you . take the first step and do it . 
Thanks very much . 
I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world technology that I picked up from IKEA : this box . 
This box contains one billion people . 
And our teacher told us that the industrialized world families . 
And their aspiration was to buy a car . 
And in 1960 , all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this 
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world , which we still use linguistically when we talk about `` the West world population . 
Just look how many . 
The world population has doubled since I went to school . 
And of course , there 's been most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them . 
They are as they were 50 years ago . 
The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions , the three billions here , which are also no longer any gap . 
But the distance from the poorest here , the very poorest , to the very richest over here is wider than ever . recently , and I listened to what 's happening in China , and it 's pretty sure that they will catch up , just as Japan did . economically . 
And if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy ( among emerging economies ) we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end we already have this ( growth ) in process . 
But if , and only if , ( the poorest ) get out of poverty , they get 
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles . 
Every bubble is a country . The size is population . 
The colors show the continent 
The year is 1960 . 
And down here , child survival , the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school : 60 percent , 70 
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go . 
Can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ? world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion . 
Can you see the poorest billion really getting world population ( growth ) to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent . 
That 's why investments by Gates Foundation , 
And will it happen ? 
Well , I 'm not an optimist , neither am I a pessimist . 
I 'm a very serious `` possibilist '' 
Remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life . 
This will not happen ( again ) . that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life : schools , hospitals , workplaces , factories , offices , etc. 
And something that I see They 're doing it in a very simple way , by calling their mom from work , by IMing from their office to their friends , by texting under channels such as email , the mobile phone , texting , etc. 
What we 're actually going to see is that , fundamentally , people are communicating on to , has two-way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender . 
Academic research on instant messaging also are quite disappointed . 
I mean , I 've been a bit disappointed sometimes when I saw this data and all this deployment , just for five people I think are quite good examples . 
The first gentleman , he 's a baker . 
And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in manages to sneak away from the factory floor , where there is CCTV by the way , and find a corner , where at 11 o'clock at night he a week . 
But once a fortnight , they actually put the computer on their dining table , pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their very good anthropologist who is working on Filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the Philippines , was telling me about how much parenting is going on they have it open . 
Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other . 
And this is exactly what we 've been seeing with teenagers office . 
But it could be in a school , it could be an administration , it could be a hospital . 
Three settings that , if or somewhere . 
If you were in management , oh , that was a different story . 
Maybe you had a direct line . 
If you expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you . 
That was where the well . 
It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices : rituals of entry , rituals of exit , the schedules , the uniforms started about 150 years ago . 
It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy , and of industrial revolution . 
When people basically had to go on top of the workshops where they were working . 
And if you think , it 's permeated our whole culture , even our cities . 
If job and of the person carrying out , the more removed he would be from his personal sphere . 
People have taken this amazing possibility of actually being office . 
I really think that the number is conservative . 
In my own research , we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 Iraq having daily contact with their families . 
But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access . 
And every day , every single day which have always been the arguments for social control , in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who , in fact , was ever transplanted . 
In the front , you see , actually , Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant , while in the back room 
But we have a major shortage of organs . 
In the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled . 
While , but also for tissues . 
Trying to replace pancreas , trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson 's . 
These are major issues . of actual therapies for organs . 
Would n't it be great if our bodies could regenerate ? 
Would n't it be great if we could actually harness 
And this is actually real photography , timed photography , showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days . 
You see the scar form . 
As you age , as you get older . 
Your bones regenerate every 10 years . 
Your skin regenerates every two weeks . 
So , for scar tissue to move in , to seal itself off from the outside . 
So , how can we harness that power ? 
One of the you can actually use as a bridge . 
If you build that bridge , and you close off from the outside environment , then you can create that six months later on the right-hand side you see this reengineered urethra . 
Turns out your body can regenerate , but only for small distances . 
The much larger than one centimeter ? 
Then we can start to use cells . 
The strategy here , is if a patient comes in to us with then use scaffold materials . 
To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse , or your shirt , but actually these materials are fairly piece of muscle . 
This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle . 
We take 
That 's what you 're seeing here . You 're seeing this muscle bio-reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth . 
Okay . These are flat structures what we do is we , to make a blood vessel , same strategy . 
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types . device . 
It has the same conditions as a human body , 37 degrees centigrade , 95 percent oxygen . 
You then exercise it , as what complex because you 're introducing two different cell types . 
But they are really acting mostly as conduits . 
You 're allowing fluid or air to go . 
We then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components , muscle , and these bladder specialized cells . 
We grow the cells outside piece of tissue , six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient . 
This actually shows the scaffold . 
The trials we just had different sizes , small , medium , large and extra-large . 
It 's true . 
And I 'm sure everyone here wanted an , and you can now see here , the valve leaflets opening and closing . 
We exercise these prior to implantation . 
Same strategy . 
And weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold . 
This is actually digits that we 're engineering . 
These are being layered , one layer at , the liver , the kidneys . 
This is actually an example -- several strategies to engineer solid organs . 
This is actually one of the strategies about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract . 
This technology was developed by Tao Ju , who worked at our institute . , top panel , you see a liver . 
We actually take the donor liver , we use very mild detergents , and we , by using these made up of collagen , a material that 's in our bodies , that will not reject . 
We can use it from one patient to the next remains intact . 
We then take the cells , the vascular cells , blood vessel cells , we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient 's own cells painting that you saw , the first slide I showed you , 90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney , 90 is how to make them larger , and that is something we 're working on right now at the institute . 
One of the things that I wanted not use smart biomaterials , then we 'd rather use your very own cells . 
Why ? Because they will not reject . 
We can take cells organ . 
Why ? Because we 'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want . 
A windpipe cell already stem cells . 
If we can not use stem cells from your body then we 'd like to use donor stem cells . 
And we prefer cells I just showed you this presentation , everything looks so good , everything works . Actually no , these technologies really are not that easy . 
Some of . 
And there you see the stagecoach driver , and he goes , on the top panel , He goes A , B , C , D , 've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients . 
And when we launch these technologies short clip , It 's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs . 
We started implanting some of these structures over are just taking five seconds . 
This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of .
