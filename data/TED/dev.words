up around quirky , colorful characters who were great at making with their hands . 
And my childhood is more hick than I could ever possibly relate to . 
And my dad is the most voracious reader I know . 
He can read a novel or two a day . 
But when I was fly in the house with a gun -- but what was so amazing to me was that he knew just enough how to pump it . 
And he art world and the contemporary art scene . 
A few years ago , I spent months in Europe to see the major international art exhibitions that have the one of it , I was longing for more work that was appealing to a broad public , that was accessible . 
And the second thing that I have to have some criteria of how to choose work . 
So amongst all the criteria I have , there 's two main things . 
One of my other second set of rules -- I hate to say `` rules '' because it 's art -- my criteria would be the three H 's , which do this biennial , how am I going to travel the world and find these artists ? 
And then I realized one day , there 's an easier 
I figured out their bios , their passions in life and their art styles , and I started making their work . 
I felt , oh this is is quite a bit . 
And I 'm such a technician , so I loved this project , getting to play with all the techniques . 
So this one . 
I know I should mention : I 'm making all these things . 
This is n't Photoshopped . 
I 'm under the river taking giant mirrors -- and here she 's taking giant mirrors and pulling them into the dirt . 
And this is 22 feet long . 
And what . 
And so you 're standing there and everything else is dark , but there 's this portal that you want to jump in . 
This piece Made '' . 
And she 's making weather on her body 's scale . 
And this piece is `` Frost '' . 
And what she did next artist , this is a group of Japanese artists , a collective of Japanese artists -- in Tokyo . 
And they were interested in developing a new you get a real piece , and maybe not . 
Well this has sparked a craze in Japan , because everyone 's wanting a masterpiece . 
And piece because I have a little cousin at home who introduced me -- which I think is such a great introduction -- to a friend one day as , 
And what he does is -- he spends a week at a time with a family . 
And he shows up on their porch , their doorstep , through everything they have , and he finds materials to make work . 
And he makes a work that answers what they think great art is . , like in his series where he used rain to make paintings . 
This project is called `` Love Nests '' . 
What he did was to 
Next is Sylvia Slater . 
Sylvia 's interested in art training . 
She 's a very serious Swiss artist . 
And she was thinking about them . 
And you would carry this around with you , and if everything went to hell , you could make payments and buy your life . precious metals and gemstones . 
And this one had to get broken up . 
He had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently with death . 
So they came up with `` dig jigs '' . 
And a dig jig -- a dig jig is where , for a milestone 're going to go do some work '' . 
And so we got to the grave and made this , which was hilarious -- the attention that we as an animal , how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage . 
You know , we look down a dark alley or a jungle path , trying specimens . 
And he pairs these up with paintings . 
Like this is a painting of a snake in a box . 
So you open the would learn a lot about culture if I created a culture that does n't exist from scratch '' . 
So that 's what she did . 
She 
This is a typical angora embroidery for them . 
This is one of their founders , Gert Schaeffer . 
And actually this is my Aunt Irene the Silver Dobermans , and their motto is to spread pragmatism one person at a time . 
And they 're really interested in how over-coddled we 've become tradition of scholar stones . 
Next is Maynard Sipes . 
And I love Maynard Sipes , but he 's off in his own world , and , What an Artwork Does When We 're Not Watching '' . 
Next is by a Lithuanian fortune teller , Jurgi Petrauskas . 
Next is Ginger Cheshire . 
This is from Estelle Willoughsby . 
She heals with color . 
And she 's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists , even though the eyes because she 's kind of scary . 
And it 's good that she 's not real ; she 'd be mad that I said that . all together with those other 77 you 're not seeing , that 's my biennial . 
Thank you . Thank you . 
Thanks . 
Thank you they know what origami is . It 's this : flapping birds , toys , cootie catchers , that sort of thing . 
And that is what origami 
If you look close , it 's this shape , called a crane . 
Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane . 
So this art designs . 
But even more importantly , he created a language , a way we could communicate , a code of dots , dashes and arrows . this shows where we 've gone in the modern world . 
Naturalism . Detail . 
You can get horns , antlers -- even , if you look -- and in origami -- is letting dead people do your work for you . 
Because what you can do is take your problem , and turn it they 're very simple , easy to understand . 
The first law is two-colorability . You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having to a straight line , all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line . 
And if you look at how the layers stack , you 'll mechanics can be written down on a napkin , and yet they govern all of chemistry , all of life , all of history . 
If we obey when we put it together , we get something a little different . 
This fish , 400 scales -- again , it is one uncut square , only a rattlesnake . 
And this guy 's on display downstairs , so take a look if you get a chance . 
The most powerful tools in origami beetle -- it 's got two points for jaws , it 's got antennae . Can you be that specific in the detail ? '' 
And yeah , a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject , a flap for every leg . 
And then once I have that folded shape 's hard . 
But that 's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump . 
And I 'm going to show you all fold it again , until it gets long and narrow , and then we 'll say at the end of that , that 's a flap . 
I 's left over . 
I can use it for something else . 
Well , there are other ways of making a flap . 
There are other 
If I put the flap on the edge , it uses a half circle of paper . 
And if I make the flap from the middle , , origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles . 
And here 's where the dead people start to rules . That gives you the folds . 
Those folds fold into a base . You shape the base . 
You get a folded shape -- in computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker , and you can download it from my website . 
It 's free . It runs on all the 
And if you take this crease pattern , you fold on the dotted lines , you 'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer , . 
We found we could do insects , spiders , which are close , things with legs , things with legs and wings , things with legs and grizzly bear has claws . 
This tree frog has toes . 
Actually , lots of people in origami now put toes into their models . 
Toes complicated instrument . '' 
Well , then you could do an organ . 
And what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand . 
So now show you , this really was folded paper . 
Computers made things move , but these were all real , folded objects that we made . 
And 
One of the earliest was this pattern , this folded pattern , studied by Koryo Miura , a Japanese engineer . 
He studied a folding pattern , and 
The telescope , going up in space , it unfolds in two places . 
It folds in thirds . It 's a very simple pattern -- you miles up , 100-meter diameter lens . 
So , imagine a lens the size of a football field . 
There were two groups of people who were you make a large sheet of glass smaller ? 
Well , about the only way is to fold it up somehow . 
So you have to do 's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing '' . 
So they looked into the origami community , we got in touch with them , a quarter-mile focal length . 
And it works perfectly on its test range , and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle . 
Now , that works whether you 're going into space , or whether you 're just going into a body . 
And this example is the latter . 
This of getting flat sheets into a small space . 
And they want to do their design by simulation . 
So they need to figure out how , to a really interesting idea . 
You know , where did these things come from ? 
Well , the heart stent came from that little blow-up box , problems that you solve for aesthetic value only , or to create something beautiful , turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world 
These are chemical clocks , and they 're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell . away . 
It 'll do this for weeks , until it kind of gradually loses the plot . 
And it 's incredible to watch , but there them into a bunker , deep underground , for a couple of months . 
People actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of raving in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside . 
So fine , we have course , we 've spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada , where I live , we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours ? 
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense ? 
Well , it turns out that when people are living without any sort a modern day never sees . 
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime , that they realize they 're experiencing true wakefulness for and World War II caught me when I was between seven and 10 years old . 
And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew were teenager , to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question . 'd seen in the center of Zurich , and it was about flying saucers ( that ) he was going to talk . 
And I thought , well sky . 
He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order many people have presented , and there are many variations on it . 
But this , for instance , shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed -- which corresponds more or less to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level -- increases in material well-being do n't seem to affect how happy normal experience -- do we feel really happy ? 
And to start those studies about 40 years ago , I began to look at creative people -- first long . 
But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview . 
And it describes how he feels when . 
And it 's interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been 
These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated , more ordered form . 
Now . 
He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks , and as he does that , he can imagine sounds that had that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration . 
But actually , our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per this man is , he does n't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels , or his problems at home . 
He ca n't hand seems to be moving by itself . 
Now , I could look at my hand for two weeks , and I would n't feel any awe or of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field . 
Whether it 's mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in '' . 
And it happens in different realms . 
For instance , a poet describes it in this form . 
This is by a student of he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked . 
But it happens in other activities . 
For instance , this is another student of mine happens also , actually , in the most recent book I wrote , called `` Good Business '' , where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been want a meaningful and successful job . 
Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed . 
She is the founder of Body Shop , the 
And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation , be aware of their mission to work . 
And regardless of the culture , regardless of education or whatever , there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger . 
And once the conditions are present , what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own 
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow , and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average . 
Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there . 
Your skills are not quite as high as they should be , but you can move excited . 
It 's not very challenging any more . 
And if you want to enter flow from control , you have to increase the challenges . there 's no challenge . 
Unfortunately , a lot of people 's experience is in apathy . 
The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television more and more of everyday life in that flow channel . 
And that is the kind of challenge that we 're trying to understand . 
And some conversation that we started with . 
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state with too much time on my hands . 
Yves Behar : , much to the dismay of my mother . 
YB : To the dismay of my mother , this is dangerous teenage fashion right there . 
FN and design and ... 
FN : Really make a fully integrated product , something beautiful . 
YB : And we made a baby . 
FN : came up with our name and logo . We 're Mission Motors . 
And we 've only got three minutes , but we could talk about it for how , as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it , `` Once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up , and hope and as closed and set in their ways , as slow to respond to new challenges , as small and risk-averse . 
And in fact they were n't . to flip these old assumptions , for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term . 
This entrepreneurial energy it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago . 
What I want to do is share some of the in history when the average person has more power than at any time . 
What I 'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments , 
He said , `` We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
